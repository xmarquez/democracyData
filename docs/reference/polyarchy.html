<p>The Polyarchy Scale and the Contestation Scale are quasi-Guttman scales
using polytomous items.</p>
<p>The Contestation Scale is a less precise but more reliable version of the
Polyarchy Scale.</p>
<p>For that scale, there were two coders--Coppedge and Reinicke. A reliability
check was later performed by Anna Papavlachopoulou. Beginning in 2003,
Coppedge had the undergraduate students in his quantitative methods course
replicate the coding for all countries as of July 1, 2000.</p>
<p>In 2003, 11 students coded 60 randomly-selected countries. In 2004, 15
students coded 85 countries. In 2005, 15 students coded the remaining 47
countries (and 3 countries repeated from 2003). Each year, five countries
were coded by every student and these initial codes discussed, and
sometimes revised, before coding the rest.</p>
<p>In 2003 and 2004, the rest of the countries were each coded by 3 students
each. In 2005, the rest of the countries were coded by 5 students each.
Because some of the ratings were based on weak agreement, in 2006 nine
graduate students were asked to code them, and others from 2000,
independently. Their ratings have been pooled with those of the
undergraduate coders and the scalogram analysis repeated. This resulted in
modified ratings for 21 countries (11 percent): 5 becoming less polyarchic,
16 more polyarchic.</p>
<p>The data posted here are the revised data. The earlier ratings are
available on request. For the 1985 data, multiple sources of information
were used. For the 2000 data, all coders consulted only the State
Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001 as their
source of information. This information is available on line at
<a href='http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/'>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/</a>.</p>
<p>Every year, 82-86 percent of their ratings were in agreement. This is about
the same level of reliability that Reinicke and Coppedge reported in 1990.
For the data presented here, however, Coppedge selected the modal rating
for each country on each variable and repeated the scalogram analysis.</p>
<p>Because some different scale types were found in 1985 and 2000, Coppedge
decided to combine categories 4 and 5, and 8 and 9, in order to produce a
more reliable scale, the Contestation scale. This scale ranges from 9
(greatest contestation) to 1 (least contestation). To convert the old scale
into the new one, if old&lt;=5, new=9-old; if 5&lt;old&lt;9, new=10-old; if old&gt;=9,
new=11-old.</p>
<p>Note that the new coding corrects the confusing convention of the Polyarchy
Scale of having the lowest score represent the most democratic level.
Categories are combined in the aggregated scale only, not in the component
variables. This increases reliability while minimizing the loss of
information. There is still a one-to-one correspondence between scale
scores and the brief descriptions of the scale types, although types 2 and
5 build in a greater variety of ways to attain those scores.The coefficient
of reproducibility for the 2000 Contestation scale (allowing for combined
ranks) is .950. Coefficient alpha for its four variables is .927.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="variables"><a class="anchor" href="#variables"></a>Variables</h2>

    


<p>Ratings are based on actual practice rather than formal constitutional
provisions.</p>
<p>When there is regional diversity in the regime, pay attention only to the
largest, most populous, and most politically important region(s) of the
country.</p>
<p>Read the coding criteria carefully and refer to them often to make sure you
are applying them faithfully.</p>

<dt>altinf</dt><dd><p>Media pluralism.1	Alternative sources of information exist and are protected by law. If
there is significant government ownership of the media, they are
effectively controlled by truly independent or multi-party bodies.2	Alternative sources of information are widely available but government
versions are presented in preferential fashion. This may be the result of
partiality in and greater availability of government-controlled media;
selective closure, punishment, harassment, or censorship of dissident
reporters, publishers, or broadcasters; or mild self-censorship resulting
from any of these.3	The government or ruling party dominates the diffusion of information to
such a degree that alternative sources exist only for nonpolitical issues,
for short periods of time, or for small segments of the population. The
media are either mostly controlled directly by the government or party or
restricted by routine prior censorship, near-certain punishment of
dissident reporters, publishers, and broadcasters, or pervasive
self-censorship. Foreign media or the Internet may be available to a small
segment of the population without restrictions.4	There is no public alternative to official information. All sources of
information are official organs or completely subservient private sources.
The media are considered instruments of indoctrination. Foreign
publications and the Internet are usually unavailable or censored, and
foreign broadcasts may be jammed.</p></dd>

<dt>fairelt</dt><dd><p>Fair elections.1	The most important effective heads of the government are elected, and
national elections take place without significant or routine fraud or
coercion, or with incidents of fraud or coercion that are likely to be
punished.2	The most important effective heads of the government are elected, but
national elections have significant fraud or coercion that goes unpunished,
such as widespread voter intimidation or assassination of candidates,
whether it changes the winner of the election or merely alters the margin
of victory.3	No meaningful elections: i.e., elections without choice of candidates or
parties, or no elections at all.</p></dd>

<dt>freorg</dt><dd><p>Freedom of organization.1	Some trade union or interest groups may be harassed or banned but there
are no restrictions on purely political organization for parties that have
not previously committed mass murder. Permits may be required but are not
used to limit opposition activities.2	Some political parties that have not committed mass murder are banned and
trade unions or interest groups are harassed or banned, but membership in
some alternatives to official organizations is permitted. Permits may be
required and are used to limit opposition activities.3	The only relatively independent organizations that are allowed to exist
are nonpolitical.4	No independent organizations are allowed. All organizations are banned or
controlled by the government or the party.</p></dd>

<dt>frexp</dt><dd><p>Freedom of expression.1	Citizens express their views on all topics without fear of punishment.2	Dissent is discouraged, whether by informal pressure or by systematic
censorship, but control is incomplete. The extent of control may range from
selective punishment of dissidents on a limited number of issues to a
situation in which only determined critics manage to make themselves heard,
yet they sometimes can sway public opinion. There is some freedom of
private discussion.3	All open dissent is forbidden and effectively suppressed, though a few
citizens may express dissent publicly in covert ways. Citizens are wary of
criticizing the government even privately.</p></dd>

media.4	patterns = 3222, 2223, 3223, or 3322	Like score 5 except that there is
less contestation in one or two of the following respects: no meaningful
elections are held, only nonpolitical organizations are allowed to be
independent, or alternatives to the official media are very limited.3	pattern = 3323	No meaningful elections are held, only nonpolitical
organizations are allowed to be independent, some public dissent is
suppressed, and alternatives to the official media are very limited.2	patterns = 3423, 3333, 3424, 3433, or 3334	Like score 3 except that there

all public dissent is suppressed, or there is no public alternative to

<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>

<p>The <code>polyarchy_pmm</code> version of this data is taken from from Pemstein,
Daniel, Stephen A. Meserve, and James Melton. 2013. "Replication data for:
Democratic Compromise: A Latent Variable Analysis of Ten Measures of Regime
Type." In: Harvard Dataverse.
<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/PMM'>http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/PMM</a>. The
original dataset is found in <code>polyarchy</code>. It only contains a reversed
version of the <code>poly</code> variable in the original <code>polyarchy</code> dataset (higher
values being more democratic). 22 country-years differ between PMM's
replication data and the original Polyarchy dataset (Coppedge and Reinicke
1991), and four are missing. These seem to be due to simple transcription
errors. See the vignetter for more details.</p>
