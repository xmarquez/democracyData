<dl><dt>anrr_country</dt>
<dd><p>The country name, as in the original dataset, with
minimal modification (Sao Tome and Principe). Use
<code>extended_country_name</code> instead if you want a consistent name.</p></dd>

<dt>dem</dt>
<dd><p>The democracy variable (1 = democratic, 0 = non-democratic). The
supplementary material describes the construction of the variable as
follows (I copy, paste, and lightly edit from pp. A1-A2):</p>
<p>We construct our consolidated measure of democracy using <a href="download_fh.html">Freedom House</a> and <a href="polityIV.html">Polity IV</a> as our main
sources. We also use secondary sources to resolve ambiguous cases (those in
which Polity and Freedom house report contrary assessments) or those
without data coverage in Freedom House or Polity IV. For instance, Freedom
House only covers the period since 1972, so we use secondary sources and
the Polity IV index to code our measure of democracy prior to this period.
Likewise, Polity IV does not cover some small countries that are in the
Freedom House sample and in other secondary sources. The secondary sources
are the dichotomous measures introduced by Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland
(2010) - henceforth <a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> - and Boix, Miller, and Rosato (2012)</p><ul><li><p>henceforth <a href="bmr.html">BMR</a>. Both measures extend and refine Przeworski et
al.'s (2000) measure of democracy. Finally, we use Papaioannou and
Siourounis's (2008) data--henceforth PS--which contains the exact year of a
permanent transition to democracy for many of the countries in our sample,
but that does not include temporary transitions in and out of democracy.</p></li>
</ul><ol><li><p>We code a country c as democratic in year t if Freedom House regards it
as "Free" or "Partially Free" and Polity IV gives it a positive democracy
score (The Polity IV index is between -10 and 10). This procedure generates
the bulk of the variation in our democracy measure.</p></li>
<li><p>For small countries that only appear in the <a href="download_fh.html">Freedom House</a> sample, we code them as democratic if their
Freedom House status is "Free" or "Partially Free," and either
<a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> or <a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> consider them to be democratic. There
is overwhelming agreement between Freedom House, <a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> and
<a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> in all such cases, making the coding straightforward. The
only ambiguous case is Samoa, which is coded as "Free" since 1989 by
<a href="download_fh.html">Freedom House</a>, while <a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> and
<a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> both code it as nondemocratic. We follow the latter coding
since rulers in Samoa have a long tenure and are appointed to office for
life. Besides this particular case, there are some countries for which only
Freedom House provides information for the years 2009 and 2010 (the
<a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> and <a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> sample ends in 2008 and 2009
respectively). These include Afghanistan, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bosnia
&amp; Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Dominica, Grenada, Iceland, Iraq,
Kiribati, Luxembourg, Maldives, Malta, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Seychelles, St.
Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; Grens., Suriname, Sao Tome and
Prıncipe, Tonga and Vanuatu. In all of these cases the Freedom House
indicator remains the same since 2008, so we assume these countries remain
in the same political regime that was in place in 2008.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom House does not provide any data before 1972. For these early
years, we code a country as democractic if it has a positive Polity score
and either <a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> or <a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> code it as democratic. There
are a few cases coded as nondemocracies by <a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> and
<a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> with a positive <a href="polity">Polity</a> score. In these cases, the
<a href="polityIV.html">Polity</a> score is always near zero and we code the
observation as a nondemocracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Ex-Soviet and Ex-Yugoslav countries are coded as nondemocracies before
1990, based on the USSR and Yugoslavia scores before their dissolution.</p></li>
<li><p>When both Freedom House and Polity are missing (174 observations for 16
countries), we rely on our secondary sources and code our measure of
democracy manually. The first country is Antigua and Barbuda, which is
coded as democratic following its independence in 1981. Barbados is set as
democratic from its independence in 1966 until it enters the Freedom House
sample in 1972, after which Freedom House codes it as democratic. Germany,
Iceland, and Luxembourg are coded as always democratic. This matches the
Freedom House coding once they enter into its sample. Kuwait is set to
nondemocratic in 1961 and 1962, until it enters the Polity sample in 1963
and is also coded as nondemocratic. The Maldives are set as nondemocratic
from its independence in 1965, until they enter the Freedom House sample in
1972 and is also coded as nondemocratic. Malta is set as democratic from
its independence in 1964, until it enters the Freedom House sample in 1972
and is also coded as democratic. Nauru is set as democratic from its
independence in 1968 until it enters the Freedom House sample in 1972,
remaining democratic. Syria is coded as nondemocratic in 1960 when it was
not in the Polity sample. It remains nondemocratic in the Polity sample.
Tonga is coded as nondemocratic since its independence. This matches the
Freedom House coding when it enters the sample. Vietnam and Yemen are coded
as always nondemocratic, but they are not in Polity and Freedom House prior
to their unification. However, they were nondemocratic according to all
secondary sources. Samoa is nondemocratic since its independence based on
<a href="pacl.html">CGV</a> and <a href="bmr.html">BMR</a> for years in which Polity and Freedom
House are missing. Finally, Zimbabwe is also nondemocratic in 1965-1969,
according to our secondary sources.</p></li>
<li><p>We remove spurious transitions created when countries enter or leave the
Freedom House, Polity, or our secondary sources' samples. For instance,
these spurious transitions arise when a country appears in (or leaves) the
sample for one of our sources that gives it a more (or less) favorable
assessment than the others. This is the case for Cyprus, Malaysia, Gambia,
and Guyana, which we handled manually. The particular coding of these
countries does not affect our results. We follow most sources and code
Cyprus as democratic after 1974. Malaysia is coded as nondemocratic
throughout. Guyana is coded as nondemocratic between 1966 and 1990 and
democratic in all other years. Finally, Gambia is coded as democratic
between 1965 and 1993 only.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we perform an additional refinements of our measure and adjust
it to match the dates for permanent democratizations that PS coded. These
dates are available for 68 transitions in our sample (recall PS only code
permanent transitions), and are based on historical sources. Some special
cases, for which PS transition dates and our coding are not close in time,
include Guatemala, El Salvador, Iran, Tanzania, and South Africa. For
Guatemala, our coding described above dates a democratization in 1986,
while PS code a permanent transition at the end of the civil war in 1996.
For El Salvador, we code the democratization episode in 1982 based on
Freedom House and Polity, while PS code it in 1994. We do not detect any
transition to democracy for Iran and Tanzania. In all of these cases we
keep our original coding. Our coding produces a transition to democracy in
South Africa during the early 80s based solely on Freedom House and Polity.
However, PS and all secondary sources agree that the official
democratization was in 1994, so we use this date.</p></li>
</ol><p>Our dichotomous measure of democracy is available for 183 countries and
covers their postindependence period since 1960 and until 2010. Out of the
8,733 country/year observations, we code 3,777 instances of democracy and
4,956 instances of nondemocracy. Out of the 183 countries, 45 are always
democratic, 45 are always nondemocratic, and the rest transition in and out
of democracy. A total of 122 democratizations and 71 reversals suggest
significant within-country variation in our democracy measure.</p></dd>

<dl><dt>extended_country_name</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward

entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. &amp; Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate

<dd><p>Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is

particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>
