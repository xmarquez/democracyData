    <p>The data were originally collected by Tamar Asadurian,
Anjali Thomas Bohlken, Carolina Curvale, and Sunny Kuniyathu. They went
through several rounds of revisions and additions with the participation of
Jenny Guardado, Jean Hong, Sebastian Lavezzolo, Kristin Michelitch, Yingying
Na, Lindsay Schorr Newman, S.K. Park, Didac Queralt, Gonzalo Rivero, Kong
Joo Shin, Tolga Sinmazdemir, and Tianyang Xi. Pablo Barbera, Jeff Carnegie,
Sonke Ehret, Omar Garcia-Ponce, Jaeyoun Jung, Yu Jeon Park, and Pedro Silva
additionally checked some countries. To catch discrepancies, some variables
were checked against other data compilations. No other data source, however,
was used in its original form. The discrepancies that remain are due either
to deffinitional differences or to a different assessment of facts.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="introduction"><a class="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

    
    <p>The data set is intended to cover all countries that were or would become
independent at any time after 1917, each from the inception of the first
representative institutions or from the date of independence, whichever
comes first, through 2008. The rows of the data matrix contain information
for countries during years.</p>
<p>In general, whenever the relevant situation may change during the year,
recorded is the status as of December 31. For example, if a country had a
legislature during some parts of a particular year but the legislature was
closed at the end of the year, it is coded as closed for this year. Other
variables, however, either count the frequency of particular events during a
particular year (for example, the number of chief executives) or are country
invariant. The code -1 generically refers to situations in which a
particular variable is not applicable. This coding is not always consistent:
sometimes in such situations data are recorded as missing, for example,
presidential elections in countries where there are no presidents.</p>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="shell"><a class="anchor" href="#shell"></a>Shell</h2>

    
    <p>Note: Some countries had convoluted histories: (1) They became independent,
lost independence by being annexed by another country or by joining a
federation, and then became independent again. (2) They split and became
unified again. (3) They emerged from collapse of empires or from splits from
another country. (4) They resulted from unification of previously
independent or separate units. Our general rule is to keep as the same over
time countries under (1) and (2) but to treat as new countries those under
(3) and (4). The Baltic republics are an example of (1), Germany is a case
of (2), Serbia, which split from Yugoslavia together with Macedonia and then
from Macedonia illustrates (3), while post-1975 Vietnam is a case of (4).</p>
<p>Some countries belonged at some times to other countries. For example, the
Czech Republic, which became independent as of 1993, was a part of the
Austrio-Hungarian Empire before 1918 and of Czechoslovakia between 1918 and
1992. We refer as "supra-units" to those units that contained at least one
territory that would become independent at any time after 1917 and as
"parts" to those units that composed them. The supra-units need not be
independent: British India is an example. Colonial empires are not
considered as supra-units and they are coded as such separately.</p><dl class='dl-horizontal'>

its <code>id</code> is 1251900.</p></dd>
    <dt>id2</dt><dd><p>Identifies a particular observation by the number of a supra-unit
of which it is a part and year. For example, in 1900 Turkey was part of the
Ottoman Empire, the <code>id</code> of which is 540, so that <code>id2</code> for Turkey
in this year is 5401900. This <code>id</code> is shared among all constituent
parts of the Ottoman Empire in 1900. If a territory is not part of a
supra-unit, then <code>id2</code>=<code>id</code>.</p></dd>
    <dt>id3</dt><dd><p>Identifies a particular observation by the number of the country
of which the territory is a dependency. For example, in 1900 Kenya was a
dependency of the United Kingdom, which is country 126, so ID3 for Kenya for
the year 1900 is 1261900 If a territory is not a dependency, then
ID3=<code>id2</code>.</p></dd>
    <dt>supra</dt><dd><p>Identifies the supra-unit of which a particular unit is a part
during a particular year. Thus, <code>supra</code>=540 for all parts of the
Ottoman Empire. <code>supra</code> is coded only if <code>id</code> != <code>id2</code>;
otherwise, it is coded as missing. Note that this implies that <code>supra</code>
is coded as missing for the supra-units themselves.</p></dd>
    <dt>yrindep</dt><dd><p>is the year during which a country became independent. For
countries that were independent before year 1000 the date is set arbitrarily
at 1000. In case of entities that became unified, coded is the year of
unification. For countries that temporarily lost independence having been
annexed to other countries, the most recent date of independence is given.
For units that never became independent as such (West African Federation,
Leeward Islands Federation), the code is -1.</p></dd>
    <dt>polstatus</dt><dd><p>Current political status of the country. Coded as: -1 Does
not exist as a separate country 0 Dependency 1 Independent, not colonizer 2
Colonizer Note: The code -1 is used to keep rows of countries that were
independent, lost independence or split, and then reappeared, in fact some
of the Soviet Republics and Germany. Only occupations of territories lasting
longer than ten years are considered as constituting colonial rule. For
example, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia is not considered as colonial.</p></dd>
    <dt>occupied</dt><dd><p>Dummy for country years during which a territory was
occupied by a foreign power, as long as this power controlled central
government (until the first election of the national government) or occupied
the capital. The variable does not apply to metropolitan rule in
dependencies. Countries that are annexed to another country (for example,
Baltic republics in 1940) are not occupied. Note: A country can be a colony
and occupied only if the occupier is distinct from the colonial power, for
example, Japan in the Dutch colony of Indonesia. Coded as of December 31, so
that occupations that begin and end within the same year are ignored.</p></dd> </dl>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="constitutional-framework"><a class="anchor" href="#constitutional-framework"></a>Constitutional Framework</h2>

    
    <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt>const_onpaper</dt><dd><p>The year in which the most recent constitution was
promulgated, whether or not it was implemented. Even if a constitution is
extensively modified by amendments, it remains the same unless a new
constitution is formally adopted or the old constitution is formally
abrogated without being replaced. This variable is coded as 0 if there is no
constitution, it is coded as -1 if there is more than one constitution.
    Note: Constitutions are defined nominally, that is, a document is a
constitution if it is called that. Sometimes there are several acts that
together constitute a constitution: if they have different dates, we use the
one that regulates the selection of the chief executive. Documents called
"Instructions of government" or the like are included if they regulate the
selection of the chief executive.
    The frequency with which constitutions change differs greatly across
countries. For example, Dominican Republic had thirty-three constitutions
between 1844 and 1995, in part because every time a constitution was in any
way amended, the modified document was called a new constitution. In
contrast, Sweden changed basic provisions concerning the composition of the
legislature, franchise, and parliamentary responsibility without formally
recognizing any of these changes as a new constitution until 1975. Hence,
the constitutions coded here are not equivalent units. The "English
Constitution" was a combination of written rules (collected for the first
time between 1769 and 1777 at the instigation of the House of Lords), legal
precedents, informal norms, and unstated habits, but ever before its first
description by De Lolme in 1771, it was recognized as a stable for of
organization of government. We date it, somewhat arbitrarily, to 1688. We
also attribute this date to pre-1964 Barbados. In the case of Israel, we use
the year of first basic law, 1958.</p></dd>
    <dt>const_inforce</dt><dd><p>The year in which the constitution in force by the end
of a year was promulgated. A constitution is in force whenever its
provisions concerning the selection of the chief executive or of the
legislature (if any) are implemented. This variable equals
<code>const_onpaper</code> except that it is coded as 0 if: (1) If a constitution
was never implemented (the French Constitution of 1793, the 1976
Constitution of the Central African Republic), (2) If a constitution
provides for an elected chief executive and/or the legislature and all such
provisions are violated.
    Note: The reason to use such de facto rules is that the legal status of the
constitution is sometimes difficult to determine. For example, the Junta
headed by General Ongania in Argentina in 1966 deposed the president and the
vicepresident, dissolved the Congress, and banished political parties, while
adopting Statutes of the Argentine Revolution as an organic document
regulating the operation of the government, all seemingly without any
reference to the Constitution of 1853 (Floria and Belsunce 1988: 193). Even
more nuanced were the years 1973-76 in Chile, where views as to whether the
Constitution of 1925 remained in force were divided even among advisors of
the military Junta. Only by 1976, the Junta passed Constitutional Acts, thus
effectively abrogating the previous constitution and only in 1980 a new
constitution was adopted (Barros 2002). Some constitutions do not provide
for any kind of elections. In such cases the constitution is considered to
be in force as long as its other provisions are observed. There are also
frequent cases in which a constitution is implemented only several years
after it is adopted: for example, the first elections under the 1974
Constitution of Mali took place only in 1979. In such cases, the
constitution is considered to be in effect even before it is implemented.
This rule applies anew each time a constitution is reinstated. The coding of
constitutions in force is conservative, in the sense that a constitution is
considered to be in force if it provides for an election for both the chief
executive and a legislature and only one of them is elected. A more
stringent coding can be constructed by recoding constitutions as not being
in force if either the chief executive or the legislature is not elected.
Note, however, that even if one of these actors is not currently elected, it
may be elected during subsequent years still under the same constitutions.
    Here is a list of constitutions that did not provide for an elected chief
executive or legislature:
    1975 Angola: the legislative organ (council of the revolution) performed
both executive and legislative functions; hence, it was not counted as a
legislature. The head of the MPLA was the chief executive; he was not
elected.
    1969 Congo (Brazaville): did not provide for a legislature.
    1951 Nepal: chief executive is the monarch and there is no elected
legislature.
    1865 Mexico: sovereignty vested in emperor, no elected legislature.
    1884 British Honduras: crown colony, no elected legislature.
    1865 Jamaica: crown colony, no elected legislature.
    1939 Albania: executive power vested in the King and exercised by the King's
viceroy. Legislative power was vested in the King, and a Superior Fascist
Corporative Council appointed to assist the Crown.</p></dd> </dl>

    <p>Note: Constitutional provisions are coded as provided for in the
constitutions, that is, according to <code>const_onpaper</code>, even if the
constitution is not observed (<code>const_inforce</code>=0) or if it has fallen
into disuse or was never used. For example, the last royal veto occurred in
England in 1706 and the last unilateral dissolution in 1834 but because no
legal acts were passed to curtail these royal prerogatives they are coded as
present.</p><dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt>title_ce</dt><dd><p>Title of the nominal head of government (chief executive,
as distinct from the head of state), according to the constitution.
Nominating and dismissing powers are not executive powers. Presiding over
meetings of the council of ministers or promulgating laws are also not
considered executive powers. These rules apply even if these powers are
specified in a section of constitution that deals with executive powers.
    -1 if there is no constitution or more than one
    0 if monarch or governor general (if the constitution states that the
monarch is the chief executive)
    1 if prime minister (president of the government or equivalent)
    2 if president who cannot be removed in good behavior during a fixed term,
whether directly or indirectly elected,
    3 if the constitution gives executive powers both to president, who cannot
be removed during a fixed term, and to a prime minister. Typically, such
constitutions enumerate specific powers of the president and reserve the
remaining powers for the government.
    4 if collective,
    5 if other.
    Note: Coded mechanically as 0 for the British colonies. Chief executive is
coded as collective even if one person bears the title of the president of
the collective body, say military junta, but not of the country.</p></dd>
    <dt>dissolution_power</dt><dd><p>Dummy for the power of the head of state to
dissolve the legislature (at least the lower house) unilaterally. 0 if never
unilaterally. 1 if a unilateral (that is, not at the request of someone
else) decision of the dissolver.
    Note: Dissolution power is unilateral if the head of state can dissolve the
parliament without the consent of the government or leaders of political
parties in the legislature. It is still unilateral if dissolution requires
the consultation or consent of non-elected bodies or if there are
restrictions concerning the frequency or the period during which it can
occur.</p></dd>
    <dt>leg_composition</dt><dd><p>Captures legal provisions regulating the mode of
selection of the lower house of the legislature. Whenever there are no such
provisions but a legislature exists, the actual mode of selection is coded.
These provisions are coded whether or not the legislature in fact exists, as
long as they have not been formally abrogated or suspended.
    Rows distinguish elected vs. appointed legislatures. Ex-officio members are
considered as appointed. Columns specify whether or not there are distinct
electorates (whether people living next to each other vote for the same
seats) and/or whether the appointed seats are distributed among some
categories.
    The coding entails two levels. At the first level, as represented by
integers, we indicate whether the legislature was fully appointed, partially
appointed and partially elected, or fully elected, and whether either those
appointed or the voters were distinguished according to some criteria. In
cases of partly elected and partly appointed legislatures, the first decimal
indicates whether distinctions apply to the electorate or to the appointed
position. In cases where at least some members are appointed, the second
decimal provides information whether appointments resulted from delegation
from below or nomination from above. Thus, for example, in Austria between
1848 and 1877, voters were divided into curiae according to property
criteria: we code this case as 10. In Jordan, the legislature was elected
except for two seats reserved for Bedouins, who were appointed: the code is
7.01 since the legislature was partially appointed (7) and the
representatives were nominated from above (0.01). Finally, in Fiji in 1929,
Europeans and Indo-Fijians were elected by separate electorates, while
Fijians were appointed by the chiefs: we code is as 7.12 since the
legislature was partially appointed (7), the distinction by race/ethnicity
applied to voters (0.1), and the appointed representatives were delegates
(0.02). We ignore functional bodies such as in Yugoslavia 1974 and therefore
code them as missing. If there is a functional body along with territorial
body, we focus on the latter. Quotas, such as that some proportion of the
legislature must be female, are not considered unless there are separate
electorates for male and female seats. The codes for particular categories
are represented by cell entries in the table (table cannot be reporduced

    In addition to these codes, assemblies based on estate representation are
coded as 13. Estate assemblies were bodies divided into three of more
chambers, each of which contained representatives (or indeed all members
appearing personally) of one, and only one, legally privileged status group
or estate such as the nobility, the clergy, and the burghers of the
self-governing towns. (Ertman 1997: 21) An estate, in turn, may be defined
as a group of people having the same status in the sense in which that word
is used by lawyers. A status in this sense is a position to which is
attached a bundle of rights and duties, privileges and obligations, legal
capacities and incapacities, which are publicly recognized and which can be
defined and enforced by public authority and in many cases by courts of law.

captured under <code>f</code>, we use the variable <code>oth_exclusions</code> (see
below).
    There are cases of coexisting qualifications. We handle them as follows:
    (1) If the qualifications differ by ethnicity or religion (common in
colonies), we code the least restrictive qualification for non-colonizers.
    (2) If the qualifications are set at a sub-national level, we code the
variable as missing. (Unified countries in which franchise is regulated by
sub-units include the United States, Mexico, or South Africa before 1968,

Argentina before 1853, South Africa before 1910, and Australia before 1901).
Regulations concerning immigrants and foreign residents are not considered.

less than two-year local residence requirement. There are some cases,
however, where the law contains restrictive phrases, such as the requirement
of appearing on the tax rolls or having fulfilled military obligation, these
restrictions were not enforced. In such cases franchise was coded as 7. An
example is the Ottoman Constitution of 1876 (in force after 1908) or the
Swedish law until 1975.
    For females, we use the second digit, distinguishing only situations in

(b) in Canada between 1917 and 1920 the vote was given only to relatives of
military. (c) in some countries women voted only in some regions. Note that
if females vote in municipal elections, we do not include it since the codes
refer only to national elections.

legislature is a body that (1) issues at least some laws and (2) does not

cases where other parties are officially banned), 2 if more.
    Note: During the early period candidates typically competed in elections on
an individual basis, without any kind of centralized party organizations or
shared programs. Within legislatures, however, they often coalesced into
groups, currents, factions, "sentiments," etc. Hence, subjective judgments
are inevitable in coding this variable. Our rule of thumb was to code as
parties any kind of groups that bore a label that survived over two
consecutive legislatures. This was true in several countries of "Liberals"
and "Conservatives." In other countries, notably France between 1815 and
1848, however, the divisive issues, the parliamentary groups, and their
labels changed frequently, and such cases are coded as "none." A legislature
consisting of one party and independents is coded as one party.</p></dd>

institutional system allows at least some political pluralism. 1 if as of
December 31 there is a legislature that was at least in part elected by

    Note: Even if the legislature consisted of multiple parties but in the
election all the candidates were presented to voters on the same, single
list, we consider that voters had no choice. If there was only one party
while some candidates ran as independents, we also regard it as a situation
in which there was no partisan pluralism. If parties were banned and
everyone ran as independent, there is no opposition (see Swaziland). If,
however, parties were not banned and everyone ran without party labels, then
we regard this situation as pluralistic. The idea is that situations in
which elections are non-partisan, frequent during the early period, and
situations in which more than one party competes in elections represent
political pluralism, while monopoly of one party is a political monopoly.
    In rare cases it is possible for opposition to exist even if the legislative
election was not competitive. This occurs if a competitive presidential
election occurred during the term of a non-competitively elected legislature
(for example, El Salvador in 1977).

independently of the result of the election, that is, the government can
exist even if it is opposed by a majority of the parliament. One could think
that in cases of such elections the office of the chief executive is not at

in the aftermath of elections (Przeworski, Asadurian, Bolhken Thomas, 2011):
sometimes the monarchs ignore the electoral results but at times they
respect the results. Hence, it is not possible to decide ex ante whether the

Indicates whether partisan control over the chief executive office changed

which the relevant election occurred, not the year new government assumed
office. Hence, the first alternation in history, in the United States, is
coded as of 1800, even though the inauguration occurred in 1801. It is left
as missing in years without the relevant elections. Coded as follows:
    1 If the party and the person of the chief executive changes as a result of
an election or, where the chief executive is a monarch, the head of
government changes along partisan lines as a result on an election or the
entire cabinet changes when there is no prime minister. Also applies if
there are no parties but a manifest government candidate, who loses and
yields office. Coded as 1 only if the outgoing chief executive was elected.
Hence, alternation can occur only if the current election did not follow a
coup.
    0 If (1) The party or the person of the chief executive wins the election.
(2) There are two elections during the same year, such that the incumbent
party loses the first but wins the second (Iceland in 1959). (3) The
incumbent or its successor (party or person), who is not a caretaker chief
executive, does not run. (4) The incumbent and rival parties form a
coalition. (5) The incumbent loses and remains in office. (6) Neither the
winner nor the loser holds office after an election.
    -1 If there are elections but no discernible parties or two successive
independents or the change is between a non-partisan (caretaker, technical,
expert) government and a partisan one, unless the only role of a
non-partisan government was to ensure impartial administration of an
election,
    -2 If an election resulted in the defeat of an incumbent (party or person,
previously elected or not) and the winner assumed office but only after
someone other than the winner occupied it (except for a few cases in which
the constitution provides that an interim non-partisan caretaker should
occupy it between the election and the inauguration).
    Note: Alternations that result from a previous agreement between parties
count as alternations. Information about the partisan composition of
coalition governments is frequently not available. Hence, <code>salterel</code> is
coded as 1 even if the new chief executive was a member of an outgoing
coalition government, as long as he is a member of a different party. The
result is a bias in favor of counting alternations.</p></dd> </dl>

-1 if there was no legislature to dissolve.
    Note: Dissolutions are early if they occur at least one full year before the

legislative term is k years, then a dissolution is counted if it occurred in

dissolutions occur when they are not unilateral and sometimes simply

    <dt>coups</dt><dd><p>Number of successful coups d'etat during a given year.
    Note: A coup is any event resulting in an irregular removal or resignation
of the chief executive that involves a violent action or an explicit threat
of resorting to it, by an armed organization. Assassinations of the chief
executive are not considered coups unless the group responsible for the
action takes over the office. Whenever the rules about the replacement of
the chief executive are either not codified or unclear, the force criterion
prevails. The definition excludes resignations under pressure of popular
mobilization if no armed group (legal or not) is involved (resignation of
Carlos Mesa in Bolivia). Similarly, irregular transfers of power among
civilians that do not entail force (such as changes of communist leaders)
are not considered coups. We place no restriction on whether the armed group
causing the replacement is domestic or foreign, nor on the identity of the
incoming ruler. In particular, any military intervention of foreign powers
producing a replacement of the chief executive is coded as a coup, even if
they restore a previously elected ruler (French troops overthrowing Bokassa
in Central African Republic). As a general rule, any replacement of a
military chief executive by another military man is considered a coup,
unless the succession occurred according to pre-established rules
(Figueirido replacing Geisel in Brazil). Specifically, resignations of the
military chief executive caused by votes of non-confidence of irregular
military bodies are considered coups (Galtieri replacing Viola in
Argentina). The variable is compatible to other conventional sources such as
Powell and Thyne (2010), Marshall and Marshall (2009), and Svolik and
Akcinaroglu (2010) for the period 1950-2008, with some difference in the
interpretation of specific events. Information for the pre-1950 era is more

single ruling parties did not, while some rulers who assumed idiosyncratic
titles ("Dictator" "Guardian of Faith," "The Leader") entrusted the
operation of the government to their delegates. Coded as follows:
    -1 if it is unclear who the chief executive is or if the country is occupied
by a foreign power,
    0 if the monarch assumes directly the direction of the government,

modifications: (1) If the constitutional status of the effective chief
executive is unclear but there is someone who holds the title of prime
minister or president, coded respectively as 1 or 2. (2) If the nominal
chief executive is the monarch, coded as 1 unless the monarch occupies the

in which the executive is nominally plural but has a clear leader and in

    Note: There are cases in which the constitution provides that the head of
the government is a prime minister but the constitution is not in force and
the de facto chief executive is the president. There are also systems that
appear to be parliamentary in that the head of government is a prime
minister who can be removed by the parliament but in which he or she can be
also removed by the president without the consent of the parliament. This is
true, for example, of the 2004 Constitution of Central African Republic,
which states that "The President of the Republic is the Chief of the
Executive. The Prime Minister is the Chief of Government" (Article 21) and
gives the President the power to remove the Prime Minister unilaterally

(including assassinated) or imposed by force while the parliament was open
as well as cases in which the parliament was constitutionally dissolved and

also includes cases in which the current legislature extended its term and
those in which the parliament was dissolved unconstitutionally. Note: It is
possible for term to be 0 and the last digit of "sequence" to be "E" if the
incumbent extended the term of office while in office and lasted until the

    <dt>first_term</dt><dd><p>Year during which the first executive completed a
previously specified constitutional term, whether before or after
independence. If a new unit emerged from a breakdown or unification of
previously existing units, first term is coded separately for this new unit.
Coded according to the rules for <code>term</code>. For prime ministers, first
term is the last year of the term of the first legislature during which
succession of prime ministers followed constitutional rules. The first term
counts if the legislature was constitutionally dissolved and there was an
early election. Country invariant. Right-censored spells are coded as -1.
Note: First term has to be coded separately from term for the following
reason. Suppose that someone assumed office in year t for a k term period.
He completed the term by August 1 of the year t + k. Hence,
<code>first_term</code> = t + k. But if the ruler who assumed on August 1, t + k,
did not finish his term, then <code>term</code>=0 in t + k.</p></dd>
    <dt>mentry</dt><dd><p>Mode of entry of the last head (chief executive as given by
<code>head_title</code>) who entered during a particular year. Coded for years in
which an entry occurred (<code>heads</code>&gt;1 or <code>heads</code>=1 and the particular
position either did not exist or was not occupied previously).
    0 if by force (includes any replacement of a military chief executive by
another military, unless the succession occurred according to
pre-established rules),
    1 if openly imposed by a foreign power (includes cases when someone is
elected, overthrown by a coup, and reinstated by an intervention of a
foreign power; does not include clandestine actions, foreign sponsored
coups, foreign pressures, and the like),
    2 if selected by any not popularly elected body (e.g., by a self-constituted
junta, a single ruling party) or if self-appointed (even if followed by an
election), unless self-appointment is to the position of prime minister and
the legislature is open,
    3 if elected (directly or indirectly but at entry) or if constitutional
successor (say vice-president assuming on the death of the president). Note
that under parliamentarism elected refers to being approved by the
parliament, even if the person was not elected by voters. Prime ministers
appointed by monarchs are coded here as long as the legislature is open and
there is no single party. Includes monarchs who enter by plebiscite or
election by legislature
    4 if selected by a constitutionally empowered body but not according to the
rules of succession (say the first vice-president is skipped in favor of
second vice-president).
    Note: If there are more than two chief executives during a particular year,
the information about all but the one serving as of December 31 is lost.
This also implies that the mode of entry can equal 3 even if there are coups
during the particular year. What is coded here is entry of a person to/from
a particular office. Hence, if the title of the chief executive changed
during a particular year, say from prime minister to president, an entry to
the new position will be recorded even if the person remains the same
(<code>heads</code>=1). Note that it is possible that <code>heads</code>=1 but
<code>mentry</code> is recorded: this occurs when an office is newly created or if
it was not occupied during some period.</p></dd>
    <dt>mexit</dt><dd><p>Mode of exit of the first head who exited during a particular
year. Coded only for years in which an exit occurred (<code>heads</code>&gt;1 or if
<code>heads</code>=1 and the position was abolished or was not occupied as of the
end of the year).
    0 if by force (includes any replacement of a military chief executive by
another military, unless the succession occurred according to
pre-established rules, as well as assassinations, regardless of their
motives),
    1 if deposed by a foreign power (indicated by the presence of foreign
military force on the territory; does not include clandestine actions,
foreign sponsored coups, foreign pressures, and the like),
    2 if removed by some not popularly elected body (e.g., single ruling party),
    3 if lost an election or subject to term limits or lost confidence or
resigned for any reasons, followed by a constitutional successor, or other
good reasons, including peaceful transitions to democracy and removal by a
monarch as long as the legislature is open and there is no single party,
    4 if removed by a constitutionally empowered body but not according to
rules,
    -1 if died in office (and it is not generally known that the incumbent was
assassinated).
    Note: If there are more than two chief executives during a particular year,
the information about all but the one serving as of January 1 is lost. This
also implies that the mode of exit can equal 3 even if there are coups
during the particular year. Note that it is possible that <code>heads</code>=1 but
<code>mexit</code> is recorded: this occurs when an office is abolished or becomes
temporarily vacant.
    Note about <code>mentry</code> and <code>mexit</code>: Direct information about entry
and exit is often difficult to obtain for prime ministers. Because
constitutional changes of prime ministers are routine events, they do not
attract attention of historians. Non-constitutional changes, however,
whether prime ministers being removed by coups or by dissolutions of the
parliament by monarchs, are typically mentioned by historians. In the cases
where such information is not provided by historical sources, we assume that
the entry and the exit were constitutional.</p></dd> </dl>

    <p>The unit of observation is a sequence of events following an election in
which the office of the chief executive is at stake. An event is an election
and the subsequent occupancies of the chief executive office by different
persons. These events are coded as answers to questions formulated below.
The general syntax of coding consists of answers to who? and did (s)he?,
separated by commas. For example, suppose an incumbent, who originally came
into office by force, presented himself in the election, won, assumed and
stayed in office for four years. This sequence of events is coded as FPY,
IY, 4: FPY is a result of the election, IY records that the incumbent
assumed office, and 4 that he stayed that many years.</p>
<p>Note that only events following the elections are coded, with the exception
of the manner in which the current incumbent arrived in office. The first
three digits summarize information about the election. They are recorded
under the variable called result.</p><dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt>result</dt><dd><p>The first digit answers the question How did the incumbent
come into office?
    Note: The variable coding who is the chief executive is <code>head_title</code>.
The incumbent is the ruler at the moment when the election occurs. It makes
no difference how the current ruler assumed office: if there is an elected
chief executive, he is overthrown, and the general who overthrows calls an
election, the general is the incumbent. There are cases in which the
constitution requires the incumbent ruler to resign some short time before
the election and an institutionally designated person (say, chief justice)
administers the election. In such cases and only in such cases the incumbent
is the outgoing chief executive. If this is first election after
independence and the colony was run by a governor general (or equivalent)
without local prime minister, there is no incumbent. The monarch, even if
(s)he is the nominal chief executive is not considered the incumbent unless
(s)he occupies the office of the prime minister. The incumbent is the head
of the government.
    Answers to the first question are coded as:
    F By overthrowing someone else (If the incumbent originally came into power
by force but then had himself elected, he is elected. Plebiscites, however,
do not count as elections.)
    A Appointed by a non-elected body (If the king appoints a PM in the absence
of parliament or some junta takes over and appoints someone, not necessarily
one of its members, the chief executive)
    E Elected (An incumbent who is a constitutional successor of an elected
incumbent, say vice-president who assumes office upon the death of the
president, inherits his status.)
    T A non-partisan or caretaker incumbent appointed by an elected body
(parliament, sometimes party leaders)
    0 (zero) There was no incumbent.
    The second digit answers the question, Did the incumbent run in the
election? Coded as follows:
    P if the incumbent person run (distinguished systematically only under
presidentialism)
    S if a successor run
    N if the incumbent person did not run and there was no successor or if there
was no incumbent (Includes cases coded as T in the first digit). Note:
Successor is coded differently under presidentialism and parliamentarism.
Under presidentialism, S is a different member of the same party or a
candidate designated by the incumbent government. Under parliamentarism, as
long as the party of the incumbent is present in the election it is always
coded as S.
    The final (third) digit answers the question Did the incumbent/successor
win? The answers to this question can be Y yes N no ? cannot be determined
    Note: If the challenger cannot form a government and the incumbent remains
in office, then the incumbent won.
    Some examples: TN,: the incumbent was a non-partisan caretaker, who did not
run in the election. FPY: the incumbent came to office by force, ran in the
election, and won. Note again that if someone who originally came into
office by force had been elected once, he becomes an elected incumbent.
Hence, F applies only to the first election after a coup. ESN: either a
successor of a president (but not the incumbent president himself) or the
party of the prime minister ran in the election and lost. ES?: either a
successor of a president (but not the incumbent president himself) or the
party of the prime minister ran in the election and it is not clear who won
(no presidential candidate won a majority, which is required by the
constitution, or no party won a majority of seats necessary to form the
government).</p></dd>
    <dt>sequence</dt><dd><p>The variable called sequence consists of the result,
followed by answers to the following pairs of questions, pairs separated by
commas, with as many pairs as necessary, and a one-digit field indicating
how long the last chief executive remained in office. The full syntax is
thus: How did the incumbent get in? Did he run? (If he ran, did he win?),
Who assumed office? Did he stay in power?, ... (as many times as necessary),
How long? Who assumed office? In principle, everyone who assumed the office
of the chief executive after an election, regardless for how long, is
recorded, with the exception of constitutionally required caretakers. The
answers to this question can be:
    I incumbent (the person who was the incumbent at the moment of the election)
    W a winner of the election (other than the incumbent person)
    L a loser of the election who entered by force (or other non-constitutional
means)
    R a loser of the election who entered by constitutional means (this
typically occurred when the king appointed a member of the losing party and
the parliament was in session and did not or could not vote non-confidence)
    M military (If they take power directly. If the king appoints or a
parliament elects a military officer, they are not military here.)
    A if a non-elected power (king, military, one party) imposes someone who is
neither a winner or a loser (non-party, technical, caretaker. For example,
King Boris of Bulgaria appointed a Russian general who was not a party
member).
    T if an elected power (parliament, party leaders, indirectly elected
president) selects someone who is neither a winner or a loser (non-party,
technical, caretaker. For example, the President of the Bolivian Senate was
appointed by the Congress as caretaker when no one could muster majority
required by the constitution.)
    C if an institutional actor came in by force or by otherwise violating
constitutional rules (For example, President Kasavubu removed PM Lumumba or
the king assumed power by a coup).
    ? cannot tell
    Notes: The incumbent person remains I in the entire sequence that follows.
Other members of his party are W if the incumbent's party won, L or R if it
lost. Suppose the incumbent party lost, the king appointed a member of the
incumbent party, then appointed the original incumbent until the next
election. The sequence would be ESN,RN,IY,E Party splits are ignored. If
there was an interim constitutional occupant between the election and
inauguration, he is coded as T. For example, the sequence in which the
incumbent did not run, an interim person took over, and then the winner
assumed would be EN,TN,W. . .
    The answer to the question Did he/she stay in power? can be: Y yes N no
    Note: The answer entails a stopping rule. The sequence of events is
considered to be completed if the current occupant survived in power at
least one year and neither the incumbent, nor the winner, nor the loser
returned to office before the next election or if the current occupant
lasted less than one year but until the next election. Prime ministers of
the same party and constitutional successors of elected presidents are
considered here to be the same persons as their predecessors: if a president
dies within a year and he is followed by the vice-president,
constitutionally designated to take over, and if the total tenure of the two
is at least one year, then the answer is Y. If the president is overthrown
by force, however, then the answer concerning him is N and the
vice-president, even if he is a constitutionally designated, is treated as a
new occupant of office. Hence, "not return" means here that neither the
original incumbent nor anyone who occupied office in the aftermath of the
election returned to office before the next election.
    If the answer is Y the last digit answers the question How long?, with two
possible answers: Length of time, measured in full years if the current
ruler did not last until the next election (but at least one full year) or
if the next election did not take place within one year of the scheduled
date and the current ruler lasted until the scheduled date. For example, if
the next scheduled election was supposed to take place within 5 years and
the first person who survived in office at least one year after the current
election was deposed 3 years later, the answer is "3". In turn, if the next
election did not occur until 12 years later and the first person who lasted
one year survived the 5 years, the answer is "12," even if this person was
deposed 7 years after assuming office. "E" if the current ruler lasted until
the next election. If the answer is N coding continues, repeating answers to
both questions as long as necessary. If there is more than one election
during the same year, each election is coded as above with the sign j
separating the elections. For example, if an elected incumbent run, won,
lasted until the new election the same year, run again, and lost, the
sequence is coded as ESY,IY,EjESN,WY,E.</p></dd> </dl>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="caveats"><a class="anchor" href="#caveats"></a>Caveats</h2>

    
    <p>Caveats are many and some are consequential.</p><dl class='dl-horizontal'>
<dt>Missing data</dt><dd><p>In principle, the data should cover all
elections that selected chief executives in all countries that existed at
any time after 1917, including periods before independence. There are good
reasons to suspect that not all such elections are included: the historical
record is simply absent for some countries during the early periods. The
bias of inclusion is against early elections, particularly those in
dependent territories.</p></dd>
    <dt>Chief executives</dt><dd><p>The elections that are coded are intended to be
those which potentially determine the selection of the chief executive.
Chief executives are presidents, directly or indirectly elected, who are
heads of governments and cannot be dismissed by the legislature while in
good conduct or prime ministers whenever governments serve at the discretion
of the legislature. In systems in which presidents and prime ministers share
executive prerogatives and prime ministers can be removed by the
legislature, chief executives are prime ministers. Note that if a country
changed from parliamentary to presidential system (or vice versa, which is
less frequent), the incumbent is the occupant of the previous office. In
terms of government formation, parliamentarism is a much more complex system
than presidentialism. Tracing the individual prime ministers is often
unfeasible. Hence, sequences are more accurate under presidentialism than
under parliamentarism. A sequence ESY,WY,E under presidentialism states
exactly that the incumbent person was not a candidate, that a successor of
this person won the election, assumed office, and served until the next
election. The same sequence under parliamentarism, however, may only
indicate that the incumbent party run and won the election and one or more
of its members (but not the incumbent prime minister) held office until the
next election. To put it differently, a sequence ESY,WN,WN,WY,3 under
presidentialism may be coded as only ESY,WY,3 under parliamentarism. Note
that if the person who occupied office immediately after the election was
the outgoing incumbent, these sequences would be coded respectively as
EPY,IN,WN,WY,3 under presidentialism and as ESY,IN,WY,E under
parliamentarism (even if WY may stand here for several prime ministers from
the same party).</p></dd>
    <dt>General</dt><dd><p>Some elections constitute truly convoluted events and the
exact sequence of events is often difficult to identify. Different
historical sources frequently ignore different details, so that codes based
on particular sources could be different. Moreover, the information is
sometimes inconsistent, so that making sense of it is not always possible.
One must suspect, therefore, that the coding contains errors.</p></dd> </dl>
