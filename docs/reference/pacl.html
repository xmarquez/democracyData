    <dt>incumb</dt><dd><p>Consolidation of incumbent advantage. Dummy variable coded 1
if: (1) the regime year qualifies as a democratic regime and (2) sometime
during its current tenure in office the incumbents (person, party, military
hierarchy) unconstitutionally closed the lower houseof the national
legislature and rewrote the rules in their favor. The rationale for this
variable is discussed in Przeworski et al. (2000:20-22). We expand the action
that characterizes consolidation of incumbent advantage to include cases in
which the incumbent was first elected in multiparty elections but, for
whatever reasons, the incumbent's term was extended and subsequent elections
were postponed (e.g., Angola as of December 31, 2008).</p></dd>
    <dt>type2</dt><dd><p>Dummy
variable coded 1 for the cases excluded from the set of democracies uniquely
because they violate the "alternation" rule; 0 otherwise. These are the cases
that would be classified as democratic if the only criteria for democracy
were multiparty (direct orindirect) executive and legislative elections.
This, however, as discussed in Przeworski etal (2000:23-29) and in Cheibub,
Vreeland and Gandhi (2009), is not sufficient to identify democracies. In the
set of regimes that hold multiparty elections, some do it only because they
know the opposition cannot win and others because the opposition would not be
allowed to assume office if it won. The difficulty is that in many cases
there is no historical evidence to allow the observer to distinguish these
cases. Thus, it is possible that we might identify as a democracy a case that
is a real dictatorship, or as a dictatorship a case that is a real democracy.
The alternation rule, as well as the present variable, identifies the cases
for which we do not have sufficient information to decide,according to our
rules, whether the country is a democracy or not. Note on the type2 name: A
type I error is a false positive and a type II error is a false negative. In
the original project for which this variable was created,dictatorships were
coded 1 (positive) and democracies 0 (negative). The variable was named to
indicate that we had made a decision to avoid type II errors by coding as
dictatorships cases that might have been a democracy (thus committing type I
errors). In the current context, we think of democracy as the positive
outcome and dictatorship as the negative outcome. We should, therefore,
rename the variable type1 error since we decided to coded possible
democracies (real 1s) as dictatorships (real 0s). In the end, it does not
matter. What is important is that this variable can be used to easily
reclassify regimes by either considering all cases coded as 1 in type2 as
democracies or attempting to discriminate which ones are democracies and
which ones are dictatorships.</p></dd>

Botswana, Mutesa in Uganda, Souvanna Phouma in Laos, Mohammed Daud in
Afghanistan, and Sihanouk in Cambodia do not qualify as monarchs because they
abdicated their places in the royal line to rule as heads of republics. Part

    <p>As simple as it may be, there is no one system of numbering the countries
of the world that would allow scholars to easily merge all the varied
datasets into one overall dataset. The difficulty, of course, comes from
the fact that countries come and go and countries sometimes change
significantly their territorial basis while retaining their old names. For
some analyses (e.g., for economic or demographic time series), we want to
mark the fact that Pakistan lost the territory that became Bangladesh in
1971, or that Ethiopia lost the territory that became Eritrea in 1993, or
that Indonesia lost the territory that became East Timor in 2002. At the
same time, for some other analyses (e.g., those related to the occurrence
of elections and the changes of heads of state and government), the fact
that some territory was lost is irrelevant. For the first type of analyses,
Pakistan before 1971 should be treated as a different country as Pakistan
after  1971. For the second type of analyses, Pakistan between 1947 and
2008 should be treated as one country. The solution we found to be the most
flexible is the following:</p><ol>
<li><p>We follow the Correlates of War country code, since this seems to be the
most complete and widely used country identifier available. We create four
additional country codes (which do not match any COW country code):</p></li>
<li><p>COW assigns one code to Yugoslavia from 1946 through 2008. We consider
that Yugoslavia (COW = 345) stopped existing in 1991 and assign a new
country code to Serbia and Montenegro (1991-2006) and to Serbia (2006-)</p></li>
<li><p>COW assigns one code to the USSR/Russia from 1946 through 2008. We
consider that the USSR (COW=365) stopped existing in 1991 and assign a new
code to Russia (1991-).</p></li>
<li><p>COW assigns one number to Vietnam between 1954 and 2008 and another to
South Vietnam between 1954 and 1975. We assign different codes for South
Vietnam (1954-1976), North Vietnam (1954-1976) and Vietnam (1976- present).</p></li>
</ol>
    <p>We do not assign new country codes to countries that experienced changes in
their territories but which remained in existence after the change. These
include, for instance, Pakistan (with the creation of Bangladesh in 1971),
Cyprus (with the "creation" of Turkish Cyprus in 1983, a country not
recognized as independent - and hence not in this dataset - but over which
the "remaining" Cyprus does not govern), or Ethiopia (with the creation of
Eritrea in 1993). The variable cid provides a country coding that treats
these cases as separate countries.</p>

system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.

Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd> </dl>
