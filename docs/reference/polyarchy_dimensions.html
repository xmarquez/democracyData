    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    


<p>These variables are the first (and usually, only) two principal component
scores obtained when analyzing a dozen or more of the most commonly used
indicators of democracy. A principal components analysis (PCA) was done
separately for each year, 1950-2000. The mix of variables changed over
time, but the mix was fixed in three partially overlapping intervals:
1950-1971, 1972-1988, and 1982-2000.</p>
<p>In order to make these scores comparable over time, they were standardized.
Because these estimates are constrained to have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one, they do not reflect the changes in the mean
levels of contestation or inclusiveness, or their dispersion, that occur
during waves of democratization or authoritarianism. We therefore
calculated versions of our component scores that do reflect these trends.
First we repeated the PCA using each of the samples (1950-1971, 1972-1988,
and 1981-2000) with all the years in each sample pooled together. We then
generated the component scores for each year within each of the three
samples, based on these pooled estimates. Then we calculated the mean and
standard deviation of these pooled-sample contestation and inclusiveness
components for each year. Finally, we adjusted the original component
scores so that their annual means and standard deviations would be the same
as those of the pooled-sample estimates. Therefore, the new "standardized"
component scores are defined as</p>
<p>CONTEST' = sigma(CONTEST)t * CONTEST + mu(CONTEST)t</p>
<p>INCLUS' = sigma(INCLUS)t * INCLUS + mu(INCLUS)t</p>
<p>where CONTEST and INCLUS are the component scores estimated with annual
samples, and sigma(CONTEST)t  and  mu(CONTEST)t are the standard
deviation and mean in year t of the contestation component scores estimated
with the pooled sample; the same goes for INCLUS'. The 1972-1988 pooled
sample is used as a baseline. Standardized scores for 1989-2000 are chained
forward from 1988 based on changes in the later sample, or the average of
changes in both samples, where they overlap.</p>
<p>This adjustment yields mean scores that reflect the wave of
authoritarianism of the 1960s and 1970s and the third wave of
democratization:</p>
<p>It also shows homogenization of levels of inclusiveness after 1970. This
procedure for adjusting the component scores yields data with greater face
validity. Nevertheless, the adjustments are not very large: the
correlations between the original and standardized component scores are .97
for Contestation and .96 for Inclusiveness.</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    


<p>polyarchy_dimensions_cname: Country Name.</p>
<p>abbr: country abbreviation.</p>
<p>year: Year.</p>
<p>yr: abbreviated year.</p>
<p>CONTEST: Contestation (pooled years). This series combines the component
scores from all three samples. For the years of overlap (1982-1988), the
1972-1988 estimates are used.</p>
<p>INCLUS: Inclusiveness (pooled years). This series combines the component
scores from all three samples. For the years of overlap (1982-1988), the
1972-1988 estimates are used.</p>
<p>CONTESTstd: Contestation standardized to be comparable across years. See
explanation on introduction.</p>
<p>INCLUSstd: Inclusiveness standardized to be comparable across years. See
explanation on introduction.</p>
<p>ContestationA: Contestation (1950-71 estimate). These are estimates from
each annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>INCLUSA: Inclusiveness (1950-71 estimate). These are estimates from each
annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>CONTESTB: Contestation (1972-88 estimates). These are estimates from each
annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>INCLUSB: Inclusiveness (1972-88 estimates). These are estimates from each
annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>CONTESTC: Contestation (1990-2000 estimates). These are estimates from each
annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>INCLUSC: Inclusiveness (1990-2000 estimates). These are estimates from each
annual cross-section, pooled.</p>
<p>CRSUFF: Coppedge-Reinicke (1990) suffrage. 1	Full suffrage 2	Suffrage with
minor restrictions 3	Suffrage with major restrictions 4	No suffrage</p>
<p>FAIRELT: Coppedge-Reinicke (1990) Fair elections. 1 	Elections without
significant or routine fraud or coercion. 2	Elections with significant
fraud or coercion whether or not it changes the outcome of the election.
3	No meaningful elections: i.e., elections without choice of candidates or
parties, or no elections at all.</p>
<p>FREEORG: Coppedge-Reinicke (1990) Freedom of Organization. 1	Some trade
union or interest groups may be harassed or banned but there are no
restrictions on purely political organization. Permits may be required but
are not used to limit opposition activities. 2	Some political parties are
banned and trade unions or interest groups are harassed or banned, but
membership in some alternatives to official organizations is permitted.
Permits may be required and are used to limit opposition activities.3	The
only relatively independent organizations that are allowed to exist are
nonpolitical. 4	No independent organizations are allowed. All organizations
are banned or controlled by the government or the party.</p>
<p>FREXP: Coppedge-Reinicke (1990) Freedom of Expression 1	Citizens express
their views on all topics without fear of punishment. 2	Dissent is
discouraged, whether by informal pressure or by systematic censorship, but
control is incomplete. The extent of control may range from selective
punishment of dissidents on a limited number of issues to a situation in
which only determined critics manage to make themselves heard, yet they
sometimes can sway public opinion. There is some freedom of private
discussion. 3	All open dissent is forbidden and effectively suppressed,
though a few citizens may express dissent publicly in covert ways. Citizens
are wary of criticizing the government even privately.</p>
<p>ALTINF: Coppedge-Reinicke (1990) Alternative Sources of Information
1	Alternative sources of information exist and are protected by law. If
there is significant government ownership of the media, they are
effectively controlled by truly independent or multi-party bodies.
2	Alternative sources of information are widely available but government
versions are presented in preferential fashion. This may be the result of
partiality in and greater availability of government-controlled media;
selective closure, punishment, harassment, or censorship of dissident
reporters, publishers, or broadcasters; or mild self-censorship resulting
from any of these. 3	The government or ruling party dominates the diffusion
of information to such a degree that alternative sources exist only for
nonpolitical issues, for short periods of time, or for small segments of
the population. The media are either mostly controlled directly by the
government or party or restricted by routine prior censorship, near-certain
punishment of dissident reporters, publishers, and broadcasters, or
pervasive self-censorship. Foreign media or the Internet may be available
to a small segment of the population without restrictions. 4	There is no
public alternative to official information. All sources of information are
official organs or completely subservient private sources. The media are
considered instruments of indoctrination. Foreign publications and the
Internet are usually unavailable or censored, and foreign broadcasts may be
jammed.</p>

    <h2>Standard descriptive variables (generated by this package)</h2>
    

<dl><dt>extended_country_name</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. &amp; Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at
<a href="http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html" class="external-link">http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html</a>.</p></dd>


<dt>GWn</dt>
<dd><p>Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code, from the Gleditsch and
Ward list of independent states.</p></dd>


<dt>cown</dt>
<dd><p>The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
<a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership" class="external-link">http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership</a> for
the full list.</p></dd>


<dt>in_GW_system</dt>
<dd><p>Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>
