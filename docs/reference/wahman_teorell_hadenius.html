    <h2>NOTE ON VERSION 4</h2>
    <p>In this update between version 2.0 and 3.0
(October 10, 2007) version of the data, we have corrected some erroneous
codings in the regime type variables for Czechoslovakia (1992), Djibouti
(1992-2005), Kyrgyz Republic (1991-1994), Lesotho (1993-1997), Singapore
(1972-1980), Tajikistan (1991-1994 and 2005), and Uzbekistan (1991-1993).
We also updated the Polity 4 data for the year of 2005 (instead of using
imputed scores), which affected the regime classification of the
Philippines for that year. Between version 3.0 and 4.0 codings were
adjusted for Fiji in the period 2007-2008.</p>
<p>For each variable in the database n refers to the number of observed
country years, N to the number of countries covered.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="country-and-time-coverage">
    <h2>Country and time coverage</h2>
    <p>This data set covers the time period
1972-2010 and includes all 192 nations recognized as members of the UN
except the four "micro states" of Europe (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco
and San Marino) and two "micro states" in the Pacific that are not members
of the World Bank (Nauru and Tuvalu). In addition, we have included Taiwan
and seven states that have dissolved or merged with other states: the USSR,
Czechoslovakia, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, East Germany,
North and South Yemen, and South Vietnam. This makes a tally of 195 states.
We have treated Germany as a continuation of West Germany, Vietnam as a
continuation of North Vietnam, and Ethiopia as a continuation of itself
before the secession of Eritrea. By contrast, we treat the Republic of
Yemen, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the
Russian Federation as new states. In the case of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) Serbia is seen as the continuation of this state following the
independence of Montenegro. Cyprus refers to the Greek part of Cyprus.
Albania is treated as the same case after the independence of Kosovo.
Kosovo is treated as a new case from 2009.</p>

have better country coverage than Polity.2 Countries with an ifhpol score
larger than 7.0 are coded as democracies. 1 As we have shown in a recent
paper, this combined FH/Polity index outperforms all rival indices of
democracy in an independent assessment (Hadenius and Teorell 2005). 2
Imputed scores larger than 10 are set equal to 10. This imputation in
effect also affects the time-series information on ifhpol for countries
with some Polity data (although with less coverage than FH). In rare
instances, this means that ifhpol in these countries changes although the
underlying FH scores do not change. Source: See fhadd and revpol2.</p></dd>

<dd><p>(n:
6693, N:195) Collapsed regime type 1 Monarchy 2 Military 3 One party 4
Multi-party 9 No-party 99 Other 100 Democracy Using the mean of the Freedom
House and Polity scales (ifhpol), we draw the line between democracies and
autocracies at 7.0. We chose his threshold value by estimating the mean
cutoff point separating democracy from autocracy in five well-known
categorical measures of democracy: Cheibub et al. (2010), Boix et al
(Forthcoming) and Bernhard et al. (2001)3, together with Polity's own
categorical threshold for "democracy" and Freedom House's threshold for
"Electoral Democracy." At the core of our typology of authoritarian regime
types is a distinction between three different modes of political power
maintenance (probably the three most widely used throughout history): 1.
Hereditary succession, or lineage, corresponding to Monarchies; we define
monarchies as those regimes in which a person of royal descent has
inherited the position of head of state in accordance with accepted
practice and/or the constitution (one cannot proclaim oneself a monarch).
It bears stressing that we only apply this classification to countries
where the sovereign exercises real political power; ceremonial monarchies
are thus excluded. This occurs in Afghanistan 1979 and 2001,
Bosnia-Herzegovina 1995, Cambodia 1979, Lebanon 1990, and Solomon Islands
2003. Users particularly interested in the time-series information on
democracy for these countries should consider more case-specific imputation
techniques. 2. The actual or threatened use of military force, referring to
Military regimes, where the armed forces may exercise political power
either directly or indirectly (i.e., by controlling civilian leaders behind
the scenes). Regimes where persons of military background are chosen in
open elections (which have not been controlled by the military) thus should
not count as military. "Rebel regimes" form a special subcategory. They
include cases where a rebel movement (one not formed out of the regular
armed forces) has taken power by military means, and the regime has not as
yet been reconstituted as another kind of regime. 3. Popular elections,
designating the various electoral regimes. We distinguish among three basic
types of electoral regimes. The first is the No-Party Regime, where
elections are held but all political parties (or at least any candidate
representing a party) are prohibited. Elections in no-party regimes may
display an element of competition, but thus only among individual
candidates. Second, in One-Party Regimes, all parties but one is forbidden
(formally or de facto) from taking part in elections. A small number of
non-party candidates may also be allowed to take part and get elected;
there may be satellite parties which are autonomous in name, but which
cannot take an independent position; and competition between candidates
from the same (ruling) party may also obtain; we still code the regime
one-party. It is not enough, moreover, that a regime calls itself a
one-party state; elections in such a structure must also be held. Third,
and finally, we define Limited Multiparty regimes as regimes that hold
parliamentary or presidential elections in which (at least some) candidates
are able to participate who are independent of the ruling regime. This
classification holds even when opposition parties refrain voluntarily from
taking part in elections. It also embraces cases where parties are absent,
but where this is not the result of any prohibition against party
activities: the candidates in question have simply chosen to stand for
election as individuals. These latter we classify as Party-Less limited
multiparty systems. Finally, we have a residual category called others,
including a few cases that do not fit under any other regime type, given
the definitions applied. The categories in regime1ny are not mutually
exclusive. All monarchical regimes with amalgams (regimeny=16, 17, 23 or
24) are treated as monarchies, all military regimes with sub-types and
amalgams (regimeny=4, 5, 6, 7 or 18) are treated as military regimes, and
multiparty regimes with sub-types are treated as multiparty regimes
(regimeny =1 or 2). Only pure no-party (regimeny=3) and one-party
(regimeny=8) regimes are treated as no-party and one-party regimes,
respectively. The minor types (regimeny=9, 19, 20, 21, 22) are treated as
other. Our regime classification pertains to December 31 as of each year.

Multiparty Monarchy 100 Democracy Based on the classifications in regime1ny
we also code hybrids (or amalgams) combining elements from more than one
regime type. Monarchies may carry out elections in various forms:
multiparty elections, no-party elections, and also one-party elections. The
same goes for military regimes. In addition to the main types and their
amalgams, we have identified several minor types of authoritarian regime.
In a theocracy, decisive political power lies in the hands of a religious
elite. Temporary regimes, the purpose of which is to carry out a
transition, are classified as transitional regimes.7 There are furthermore
countries in which the official government does not in reality control the
territory. This may be due to civil war or occupation by foreign troops.

We have generally used the data when a state became independent or unified
within the (more or less) current borders. This pertains for instance to
Hungary, which is coded as independent in 1918 and not in 1001 when it was
first unified. Cases of occupation when the occupant power never
established any civilian rule has not been counted as cases of
colonisation. All countries that became independent in 1700 or prior to

<dd><p>The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. &amp; Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at

<dt>in_GW_system</dt>
<dd><p>Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>
