<p>pitfcode: PITF Country Code. Three-character country code matching those
used by the Political Instability Task Force. Some of these seem off - GER
for Germany instead of GMY, UK instead of UKG. I've created
<code>ulfelder_scode</code> on the basis of this by converting "GER","MNE","SRB","UK",
and "USS" to"GMY","MNT","SER","UKG", and "USR" respectively.</p>
<p>ulfelder_scode: Modified version of <code>pitfcode</code>, matching the Polity IV
character codes that appear to be the basis of the PITF codes.</p>
<p>cowcode: Correlates of War (COW) Country Code. Numeric country code
matching those used by the Correlates of War project. Missing some. Use
<code>cown</code> instead.</p>
<p>year: The year.</p>
<p>rgjtype: Regime Type. Categorical variable indicating the nature of a
country's political regime, understood as the institutions regulating
access to control over national policy in a sovereign state, at the end of
the calendar year.</p>
<p>D = Democracy</p>
<p>A = Non-democracy</p>
<p>NS = Not sovereign. A foreign government or international organization
either sets national policy or wields formal veto power</p>
<p>-99 = Country termination (censoring event)</p>
<p>rgjdurd: Consecutive Years of Democracy. Count in years since beginning of
an episode of democracy. Coded as missing for countries currently coded as
autocracies, interruptions, or interregna, with the exception of the year
in which a transition to any of those conditions from democracy occurs.</p>
<p>rgjdura: Time since Democracy. Count in years since last episode of
democracy or birth of country, whichever is more recent. Coded as missing
for democracies, with the exception of the year in which a transition from
autocracy to democracy occurs.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="variables-with-values-only-for-years-greater-than-"><a class="anchor" href="#variables-with-values-only-for-years-greater-than-"></a>Variables with values only for years greater than 1955</h2>

    


<p>The following variables are all <code>NA</code> for years before 1955 (by construction</p><ul>
<li><p>I do not impute their values for these years in the ulfelder_extended
dataset).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>rgjdem: Undocumented.</p>
<p>rgjtrans: Regime Change. Categorical variable indicating the occurrence (or
not) of a regime change at some point during the indicated calendar year.</p>
<p>= 1 Transition from non-democracy to democracy</p>
<p>= 0 No change</p>
<p>= -1 Transition from democracy to non-democracy</p>
<p>= -9 Country termination or onset of non-sovereignty</p>
<p>rgjtaut: Transition from Democracy to Autocracy. Dummy variable indicating
occurrence of a transition from democracy to autocracy during the calendar
year.</p>
<p>= 1 if a transition from democracy to autocracy occurred at any time during
the calendar year</p>
<p>= 0 if the country ended the calendar year as a democracy</p>
<p>= -6 if an episode of democracy was ended during the calendar year by the
onset of a period of non-sovereignty</p>
<p>= -9 if an episode of democracy ended during the calendar year when the
country ceased to exist</p>
<p>= NA if the country was not a democracy at any time during the calendar
year</p>
<p>rgjatype: Mode of Transition from Democracy to Autocracy. A categorical
variable indicating the nature of the event or process that led in an
immediate way to the end of an episode of democracy during that calendar
year.</p>
<p>= 1 Military coup: leaders of the state's armed forces claim power</p>
<p>= 2 Self-coup: incumbent officials claim dictatorial powers, cancel or rig
elections, or substantially diminish civil liberties</p>
<p>= 3 Rebellion: opposition forces seize power by means other than largely
free, fair, and competitive elections</p>
<p>= 4 Other: some other domestic actor—nearly always a monarch—usurps power
from an elected government</p>
<p>= -6 Foreign intervention: a foreign government or international
organization becomes the ruling authority or a formal veto player</p>
<p>= -9 State termination</p>
<p>= 0 No change (democracy persists)</p>
<p>= NA if the country was not a democracy at any time during the calendar
year</p>
<p>rgjaltl: Alternation in Leadership (Democracy Only). Dummy variable
indicating whether or not there has been a change in the individual
occupying the office of head of government since the start of the current
episode of democracy, as of the end of the indicated calendar year. Coded
as missing for country-years that ended with any non-democracy.</p>
<p>= 1 No change in chief executive so far</p>
<p>= 0 At least one change in chief executive</p>
<p>rgjaltlt: Alternation in Leadership “Clock” (Democracy Only). Numeric
variable counting time until the first change in the head of government.</p>
<p>rgjaltp: Alternation in Party in Power (Democracy Only). Dummy variable
indicating whether or not there has been a change in the party holding the
office of chief executive since the start of the current episode of
democracy, as of the end of the indicated calendar year. In presidential
and mixed systems, the president is the reference point. In parliamentary,
the premier is tracked. For democracies that start out with coalition
governments, any change in the composition of the coalition is treated as a
change in the party in power. Coded as missing for country-years that ended
with any non-democracy.</p>
<p>= 1 No change in party in power so far</p>
<p>= 0 At least one change in the party in power</p>
<p>rgjaltpt: Alternation in Party in Power “Clock” (Democracy Only). Numeric
variable counting time until the first change in party holding the office
of chief executive.</p>
<p>rgjtdem: Transition from Autocracy to Democracy. Dummy variable indicating
occurrence of a transition from autocracy to democracy during the calendar
year</p>
<p>= 1 if a transition from autocracy to democracy occurred at any time during
the calendar year</p>
<p>= 0 if the country ended the calendar year as an autocracy</p>
<p>= -6 if an episode of autocracy was ended during the calendar year by the
onset of a period of non-sovereignty</p>
<p>= -9 if an episode of democracy ended during the calendar year when the
country ceased to exist</p>
<p>= NA if the country was not an autocracy at any time during the calendar
year.</p>
<p>rgjepdt: Total Episodes of Democracy. Cumulative count of all episodes of
democracy for a given country, including current episode. An episode begins
with any onset of democracy (REGDURD = 1); an episode ends with a
transition from democracy to autocracy (REGTAUT = 1), an interruption
(REGTAUT = -6), an interregnum (REGTAUT = -7), or the end of a country
(REGTAUT = -9).</p>
<p>rgjhd: History of Democracy. Dummy variable indicating any occurrence of
any episodes of democracy in the country.</p>
<p>= 1 at least one episode of democracy (including current year)</p>
<p>= 0 otherwise</p>
<p>rgjhd2: History of Democracy (Restrictive). Dummy variable indicating that
at least one episode of democracy in this country has spanned five or more
consecutive calendar years.</p>
<p>= 1 yes (i.e., country has sustained democracy for at least five
consecutive years at some point in its history)</p>
<p>= 0 no (i.e., country has never sustained democracy for at least five
consecutive years)</p>
<p>rgjhd3: History of Democracy (Broad). Dummy variable indicating at least
one episode of democracy in history of current country or parent country.</p>
<p>= 1 if at least one country-year is coded as democracy for the current
country or, if current country is the result of a state break-up or
partition or was itself sovereign at some previous time, for the "parent"
country</p>
<p>= 0 otherwise (i.e., no prior country-years of democracy in current or
parent country)</p>
<p>In most instances, this variable will match RGJHD Exceptions will arise for
countries that have split, combined, or changed status in the international
system in the modern era. For example, East Germany receives a coding of
'1' on this variable due to the history of democracy in Germany prior to
World War II; Bangladesh is coded '1' on this variable from its inception
due to the democratic experience of Pakistan; and Latvia, Lithuania, and
Estonia are coded '1' on this variable due to the episodes of democracy
that occurred there after they first gained independence after World War I.</p>
<p>rgjyrdt: Total Years of Democracy. Cumulative count of calendar years in
which a country was a democracy for at least a portion of the year.</p>
<p>rgjepdl: Longest Previous Episode of Democracy. Three-digit numeric
variable indicating length in years of single longest episode of democracy
since birth of country. Equal to 0 for countries with no democratic
experience or in their first episode of democracy.</p>
<p>rgjepd1: Year of Onset of First Episode of Democracy. Four-digit numeric
variable indicating calendar year in which first episode of democracy began
(e.g., 1962), including ongoing episode, if it is the first.</p>
<p>rgjepd1a: Age at Onset of First Episode of Democracy. Three-digit numeric
variable indicating age of country at time of onset of first democratic
episode, including ongoing episode if it is the first. Equal to <code>rgjepd1</code>
minus birth-year of country, so equal to 0 for countries that were "born"
with a democratic regime.</p>
<p>rgjtadt: Prior Transitions from Autocracy to Democracy. Cumulative count of
all prior transitions from autocracy to democracy in the country in
question, including transitions that occurred in the current year.</p>

system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward

differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See

<dt>in_GW_system</dt><dd><p>Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>
