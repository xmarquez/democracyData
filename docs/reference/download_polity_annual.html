<dt>flag</dt>
<dd><p>From the Polity 5 manual, 2020 edition:</p>
<p>Each case (country-year) is flagged with this trichotomous indicator
denoting the coders' general confidence in the component variable scores
assigned during a Polity annual update. A "0" code indicates reasonable
confidence in the codings listed and is assigned to all historical cases. A
"1" code indicates that codings covering a period of up to five years since
a recent polity change are considered tentative as new authority patterns
emerge and coalesce; these cases are subject to review and possible revision
or "smoothing" ... A "2" code indicates that information is limited and, so,
there are reservations concerning the code assigned, often because a polity
change has occurred very recently and insufficient time has elapsed to
render a confident judgement of the nature of authority changes; the codes
assigned are considered a "best assessment" that require further review and
possible revision (p. 12).</p></dd>


<dt>fragment</dt>
<dd><p>From the Polity5 manual, 2020 edition, pp. 12-13:</p>
<p>Polity Fragmentation: This variable codes the operational existence of a
separate polity, or polities, comprising substantial territory and
population within the recognized borders of the state and over which the
coded polity exercises no effective authority (effective authority may be
participatory or coercive). Local autonomy arrangements voluntarily
established and accepted by both central and local authorities are not
considered fragmentation. A polity that can not exercise relatively
effective authority over at least 50 percent of its established territory is
necessarily considered to be in a condition of "state failure" (i.e.,
interruption or interregnum, see below, that may or may not coincide with
active civil war). Polity fragmentation may result from open warfare (active
or latent) or foreign occupation and may continue in the absence of open
warfare as a situation of de facto separation remains unresolved and
unchallenged by the state. Examples of de facto separation are northern
Cyprus since 1975 (with Turkish occupation), NagornoKarabakh in Azerbaijan
since 1994 (with Armenian occupation), Republika Srpska in Bosnia since 1995
(with NATO occupation), Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia from 1994,
Chechnya in Russia from 1996 to 1999, and Kosovo in Serbia from 1999 to 2008
(Kosovo became a contested, independent state in 2008). This variable is
coded beginning only in the year 2000; it is blank for all prior years
(i.e., it has not yet been coded historically).</p>
<p>(0) No overt fragmentation</p>
<p>(1) Slight fragmentation: Less than ten percent of the country's territory
is effectively under local authority and actively separated from the central
authority of the regime.</p>
<p>(2) Moderate fragmentation: Ten to twenty-five percent of the country's
territory is effectively ruled by local authority and actively separated
from the central authority of the regime.</p>
<p>(3) Serious fragmentation: Over twenty-five percent (and up to fifty
percent) of the country's territory is effectively ruled by local authority
and actively separated from the central authority of the regime.</p></dd>

<dt>polity</dt>
<dd><p>Annual polity index (<code>autoc</code> - <code>democ</code>), including values for
interruption (-66), interregnum (-77), and transition periods (-88). Higher
values are more democratic. Note that the Polity users' manual (pp. 16-17)
says that "The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in
recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the
overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this
application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index
values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the
original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority (1975)
and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary
utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more
detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic
authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist
in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data
series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that
autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority
spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the
original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for
examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note
that the middle of the implied POLITY "spectrum" is somewhat muddled in
terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and
AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses
of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original
Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.</p></dd>

necessarily transitory conditions, not polities. The PRIOR code and the
corresponding EYEAR and EDATE of the initial polity change (i.e., the first

final year of the multi-year change. This has been done to facilitate

an "interruption" period of any length while a Polity remains under foreign
authority (i.e., -66 code), or (4) an "interregnal" period denoting a
collapse of central authority (i.e., -77 code). INTERIM is coded for each
year between the end date (EDATE) of the previous Polity and the begin date
(BDATE) of the subsequent Polity whenever standardized authority codes are
used or when a series of incremental changes over a period of three years

<dd><p>The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
<a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership" class="external-link">http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership</a> for
the full list.</p></dd>


<dt>in_GW_system</dt>
<dd><p>Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is <code>FALSE</code> because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd>
