Regarding democracies, we first distinguish between republics and monarchies. We then split the category of republics into presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary systems. Within the category of monarchies, almost all systems are parliamentary, but a few countries are conferred to the category semi-monarchies. Authors differ markedly in terms of how autocratic regimes should be classified. In the present dataset, we classify autocratic countries into the following main categories: absolute monarchy, military rule, party-based rule, personalist rule, and oligarchy.

We argue that our measure’s distinguishing features—a concrete, dichotomous coding and a long time span—are of critical value to empirical work on democracy. Inspired by Robert Dahl, we define a country as democratic if it satisfies conditions for both contestation and participation. Specifically, democracies feature political leaders chosen through free and fair elections and satisfy a threshold value of suffrage. After comparing our coding to that of other popular measures, we illustrate how democracy’s predictive factors have evolved since 1800.

Definition party First, necessary define meant 'party' 'largest party' calculations. basic assumption relative strength largest political party provides realistic indicator distribution political power modern states. Competing groups formed less permanent political parties since nineteenth century, always obvious groups regarded 'parties.' Historically, factions, political cliques groups notables preceded parties. Parties understand emerged since first half nineteenth century (see Duverger 1954; LaPalombara Weiner 1966; Sartori 1976; von Beyme 1984; Blondel 1995). Many definitions political parties emphasize party organized group principal aim win political power (Michels 1962; LaPalombara Weiner 1966). According Giovanni Sartori (1976: 63-64): 'party political group identified official label presents elections, capable placing elections (free non-free), candidates public office.' think definition provides sufficient criteria distinguish 'parties' 'largest party' political groups. plausible regard 'parties' political groups take part elections identified official label. Usually, always, easy distinguish parties taking part elections. Party alliances problematic. always clear whether alliance individual member parties regarded 'parties.' cases, party's behaviour elections used decisive criterion. party belongs larger alliance permanently, justified regarding separate party. alliance treated separate 'party,' purpose measure relative strength competing independent groups. parliamentary elections 'largest party' refers party received largest single share votes seats parliament. Sometimes, depending type electoral system, proportion seats may considerably higher proportion votes, whereas reverse situation hardly possible. presidential elections, term 'largest party' refers votes received presidential candidate won election. problem , however, whether take account first second round votes, two rounds voting. percentage votes obtained winning candidate may significantly higher second round first. round voting, first round, indicated country tables. purpose take account round reflects strength parties political groups reliably. Indirect elections elections without parties Interpretation needed indirect elections, . calculate degree participation elections? basic rule votes cast final election counted. president elected indirect elections, usually parliament, number actual electors taken account, means degree participation drops zero. interpretation applied indirect parliamentary elections (China, example). However, real election takes place election electors, presidential elections United States, number votes distribution votes election taken account. Another problem interpretation concerns countries members parliament elected political parties allowed take part elections, form party groups parliament elections. election results usually interpreted mean one party taken votes seats. interpretation based assumption ruling group allow political competition power elections. Parties absent elections banned. cases \"largest party's\" share assumed 100 percent. situation different countries independent candidates participate elections, although parties banned although legally possible establish parties (Micronesia, example). cases plausible assume elections competitive elected members parliament controlled particular political group government. Independent members parliament may form least temporary political groups parliament freely. Therefore, assumed cases \"largest party's\" share higher 30 percent. Non-elected governmental institutions different question interpretation arises cases composition governmental institution using highest executive legislative power based popular election. degree competition degree participation measured cases? According interpretation, share smaller parties degree electoral participation zero cases. Power concentrated hands ruling group. interpretation applies military revolutionary regimes, non-elected autocratic governments, provisional governments, monarchies ruler government responsible ruler dominate exercise executive usually also legislative power. many historical well contemporary cases. cases \"largest party's\" share assumed 100 percent degree participation zero. Dominant governmental institutions calculation values competition participation can based parliamentary presidential/executive elections, . case necessary decide governmental institution election taken account. depends assumed importance two governmental institutions. relative importance parliaments presidents (heads state) varies greatly, usually two governmental institutions , least formally, important institutions wielding political power. Depending power divided , can speak parliamentary presidential forms government. former, legislature dominant. executive branch dependent responsible legislative branch. latter, executive branch dominant responsible legislature. also possible powers well balanced neither clear dominance. Thus can distinguish three institutional power arrangements national level: () parliamentary dominance, (b) executive dominance, (c) concurrent powers. first case values competition participation calculated basis parliamentary elections, second calculated basis presidential executive elections (lack elections), third case possible elections taken account. support competing parties elections (United States, example), make much difference governmental system classified order calculate values competition participation, electoral systems significantly different parliamentary presidential elections, incorrect classification country's governmental system might distort results measurement. true powers two institutions differ crucially. attempted classify country's governmental institutions realistically possible. classifications governmental systems indicated country tables. Interpretation classification governmental systems needed especially cases results presidential elections based second round voting. cases share elected president tends 50.0 percent higher, useful check relative strength parties taking parliamentary elections account, . elections taken account (concurrent powers), necessary weight relative importance parliamentary presidential elections. Usually reasonable give equal weight (50 percent) elections, cases may realistic give weight 75 25 percent parliamentary elections 25 75 percent presidential (executive) elections. cases relatively easy decide two branches government dominant elections taken account, cases open different interpretations. applies weighting two branches cases concurrent powers. classifications governmental systems changes governmental systems indicated country table. cases \"concurrent powers,\" estimated relative importance two branches government also indicated (50-50 percent, 25-75 percent, 75-25 percent). vanhanen_democratization Vanhanen's introduction dataset: two basic indicators democratization can used separately measure level democracy, , assumed indicate two different dimensions democratization, reasonable argue combination realistic indicator democracy either alone. can combined many ways, depending weight importance Competition Participation. researchers (see, example, Bollen 1979, 1980; Coppedge Reinicke 1988) excluded degree electoral participation measures democracy think represent significant differentiating aspect democracy. argument participation probably important dimension democracy competition. small minority adult population takes part elections, electoral struggle power restricted upper stratum population, bulk population remains outside national politics. Power sharing certainly superficial societies majority adult population takes part elections (course, presupposing elections competitive). sure two dimensions democratization important much important, weighted equally Index Democratization (ID). arbitrary choice, based assumption dimensions equally important necessary democratization. However, decision weight equally solve problem combine . One way calculate arithmetic mean. Another way multiply . also use mixture adding multiplying, example, first multiplying adding 25 percent (percentage) values indicators index. first combination based assumption dimensions indicate degree democracy independently high level competition can partly compensate lack participation, vice versa. second combination based assumption dimensions necessary democracy high level competition compensate lack participation, vice versa. come conclusion latter assumption theoretically better former one plausible assume dimensions important democracy. two indicators - Competition Participation - combined Index Democratization (ID) multiplying dividing outcome 100. decision weight indicators equally multiply means low value either two variables enough keep index value low. high level participation compensate lack competition, vice versa. Index Democratization gets high values values basic variables high. Multiplication two percentages corrects one fault Participation variable mentioned , namely, indicator thus differentiate important formal elections. still countries level electoral participation high level democracy low, elections free competitive. Multiplication two percentages cancels misleading information provided Participation cases produces low ID value. correction takes place opposite cases, level competition high degree electoral participation low.

However, subjective judgments needed also use measures democracy, possible researchers see dataset subjective interpretations .
