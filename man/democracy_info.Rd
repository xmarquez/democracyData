know about.

\section{Variables}{


\describe{

\item{dataset}{The basic name of the dataset. This usually matches the name
of the dataset included in this package, except for datasets with more than
one version (e.g., \code{gwf} matches \link{gwf_all},
\link{gwf_all_extended}, \link{gwf_autocratic}, and
\link{gwf_autocratic_extended}).}

\item{long_name}{Longer name of the dataset, or official name, if any.}

\item{main_democracy_measure_col}{The column or columns of the dataset
containing a measure of democracy. There may be more than one; refer to the
individual dataset documentation for details. If more than one measure,
these are separated by commas.}

\item{measure_type}{The type of measure. It can be dichotomous
(disintguishing only between democracy and non-democracy, with perhaps
special codes for state interruptions or no-authority conditions),
trichotomous (including a semidemocracy or hybrid category, but no other
distinctions), ordinal (including several levels of democracy), or
continuous.}

\item{based_on}{Some measures of democracy modify or build on existing
ones. Many are based on Polity data, for example. This column lists the
basis for the measures of democracy in each datasets, as far as I know
based on my reading of the sources. In some cases no relationship to other
measures could be identified; this does not mean that no relationship
exists. In other cases a measure may draw on more than one existing
dataset. (For example, Wahman-Teorell-Hadenius use both Freedom House and
Polity to help them identify democracies). An attempt to map these
relationships more systematically is made in
vignette("Relationships_between_democracy_measures").}

\item{in_pmm_replication}{Logical. Lists whether the measure is found in
Pemstein, Meserve, and Melton's (2013) replication data for their 2010
article introducing the Unified Democracy Scores (Pemstein, Meserve, and
Melton 2010). In some cases this is the only electronic source I have been
able to identify for the included measure (e.g., \link{arat_pmm}). It's
also worth noting that in a few cases (e.g., \link{prc_gasiorowski},
\link{prc_pmm}) there are some identifiable differences between the
original data and the data in the replication dataset. See the vignette in
this package for further discussion.}

\item{categorical_regime_types}{Whether the dataset contains information
about categorical regime types - primarily forms of authoritarianism (e.g.,
monarchies and military regimes).}

\item{user_extendable}{Whether the dataset is extendable in time by the
user. Some datasets (e.g., \link{gwf}, \link{ulfelder}, \link{bnr},
\link{magaloni}) contain information about regime duration that can be used
to extend their range back in time; others are latent variable indexes that
can be extended using specific packages (e.g., \link{uds}, which can be
extended using functions on this package, including
\link{generate_extended_uds}; see
vignette("Replicating_and_extending_the_UD_scores")). The "extended"
versions of some datasets are included in this package.}

\item{donwloadable}{Whether this package includes a function to download
the dataset directly from the original source.}

\item{included_in_package}{Whether the dataset is included in this package.
Some are not, either due to use restrictions, or because they are updated
with some frequency (e.g., \link{fh}).}

\item{first_published_use}{Year of first published use (as far as I know).
In some cases the data used in the first published use is very different
from the current data; for example, as far as I know the Polity I data was
first used in a 1975 study (though its compilation started in the late
1960s), but the current Polity 5 data is very different.}

\item{source_link}{A link to where the data is (or was) originally hosted.
Some of these links no longer work.}

\item{licensing_info}{Licensing info, if available. I assume CC0 unless
otherwise stated; some datasets have CC-BY-4.0 licenses.}

\item{notes}{Other notes. Evolving.} }
