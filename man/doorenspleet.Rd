Doorenspleet notes that the classification of democracy depends on two things
(pp. 391-392 of the article):

The first requirement of minimal democracies, the presence of competition,
can be seen to be met if there exist institutions and procedures through
which citizens can express effective preferences about alternative policies
at the national level and if there are institutionalized constraints on the
exercise of power by the executive. Indicators of these phenomena have
already been collated in Gurr's well-known Polity III data set, which covers
most independent countries on an annual basis from 1800 to 1994; it is
therefore an ideal source to measure the presence of competition.21 Moreover,
these data are also easily adapted to the definition of competition employed
in this analysis. In operational terms, I will consider a national political
system to be competitive if there is at least one executive chosen by
competitive popular elections (if Gurr's indicator "competitiveness of
executive recruitment" is coded 3 or 4); if all the politically active
population has an opportunity, in principle, to attain an executive position
through a regularized process (if Gurr's indicator "openness of executive
recruitment" is coded 3 or 4); if alternative preferences for policy and
leadership can be pursued in the political arena, such that oppositional
activity is not restricted or suppressed (if Gurr's indicator
"competitiveness of participation" is coded 0, 3, 4, 5); and if there are at
least substantial limitations on the exercise of executive power (if Gurr's
indicator "constraints on the power of the chief executive" is coded 4, 5, 6,
or 7).

The second requirement of minimal democracies is that there be inclusive,
universal suffrage at the national level. The norm of universality requires
that all citizens of the state--without regard to sex, race, language,
descent, income, land holdings, education, or religious beliefs--formally
enjoy the right to vote and to be elected to public office. The fact that
certain prerequisites are demanded, such as a minimum age, a sound mind, or
the absence of criminal record, does not negate this principle. Only
countries that at some stage meet the first requirement of competition from
1800 to 1994 are considered when measuring the inclusiveness of the system.
Levels of inclusiveness of the political system may be broken down into one
of the following four categories: (1) no popular suffrage; (2) suffrage
denied to large segments of the population (more than 20 percent is
excluded); (3) suffrage with partial restrictions (less than 20 percent of
the population is excluded);(4) universal suffrage or minor restrictions. For
the purposes of this analysis, countries are considered "sufficiently"
inclusive to meet the criterion of a minimal democracy if they fall into the
third or fourth category. Should they fall within either of the first two
categories or should they not meet the competition criterion, they are
classified as authoritarian regimes. Reliable data on inclusiveness are of
course difficult to obtain and to standardize, and I have had to rely on
historical sources and various monographs for each country, as well as on
Keesing's \emph{Record of World Events} and many of the standard handbooks and
almanacs. The appendix gives an overview of the years in which political
systems can be considered as both competitive and inclusive and hence are
classified in this study as "minimal democracies."

(This description suggests one could replicate Doorenspleet's measure using
data from \link{PIPE} or \link{LIED} as well as the newest version of \link{polity};
Doorenspleet uses Polity III data)}

\section{Standard descriptive variables (generated by this package)}{

\describe{

\item{extended_country_name}{The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. & Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at
\url{http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html}.}

\item{GWn}{Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code, from the Gleditsch and
Ward list of independent states.}

\item{cown}{The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
\url{http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership} for
the full list.}

\item{in_GW_system}{Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is \code{FALSE} because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
\code{TRUE} for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.} }
