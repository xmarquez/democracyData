"\link{polity5}", "\link{fh}", "\link{fh_electoral}", "\link{wgi}". It can also be empty; the
default is all of them.}

\item{selection}{A regular expression for selecting among the datasets.
Optional.}

\item{output_format}{Character. Whether to output a "wide" (each measure of
democracy in a separate column) or a "long" (a column with measure names, a
column with values) version of the data frame. Default is "long".}

\item{use_extended}{Whether to use "extended" (that is, including values
before 1945 for some regimes) versions of some datasets (\link{gwf}, \link{ulfelder},
\link{bnr}, and \link{magaloni}). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{Provides a running commentary on what the function is is
doing. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force_redownload}{Whether to re-download all datasets that can be
re-downloaded, including those archived with this package. Used only for
debugging; default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{scale_scores}{Whether to scale each measure (substracting their mean
and dividing by their standard deviation). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{keep_only_last_in_year}{Whether to keep only the last regime
measurement in a given country-year. Some datasets (e.g., \link{prc}, \link{reign})
contain more than one regime measurement per country-year in some cases (if
the regime changed multiple times during the year); setting this to
\code{TRUE} discards all except the regime measurement as of 31 December of
the year, the standard practice in most datasets. Default is \code{TRUE}.
This setting is only of interest if you set \code{output_format = "long"},
since it is ignored when \code{output_format = "wide"}, which automatically
discards all regime measurements except the last in the year.}

\item{uds_release_year}{Which release of the original \link{uds} dataset to
include. Defaults to the latest, 2014. Can be 2014, 2011, or 2010, or all
of them.}

\item{svmdi_release_year}{Which release of the \link{svmdi} dataset to include.
Defaults to the latest, 2020. Can be 2020 or 2016, or both of them.}

\item{exclude_pmm_duplicates}{Whether to exclude versions of some measures
found in Pemstein, Meserve, and Melton's replication dataset for their 2010
piece introducing the Unified Democracy Scores (Pemstein, Meserve, and
Melton 2010, 2013). See \link{blm_pmm}, \link{prc_pmm}, \link{fh_pmm}, \link{pacl_pmm},
\link{vanhanen_pmm}, and \link{polity_pmm} for details. This is included mostly to
extend or replicate the \link{uds} scores. Default is \code{TRUE}; set to
\code{FALSE} to keep these.}

\item{prefer_successor}{In some cases (e.g., Italy 1861) some datasets
contain two measurements in the same year: one for the precursor state
(Piedmont-Sardinia, which is Italy/Sardinia in \code{extended_country_name}) and
one for the successor state (unified Italy). The problem affects the
following entities in different datasets: Ethiopia (Eritrea split in 1993);
Germany (reunification in 1993); Italy (unification in 1861, previously
Piedmont-Sardinia); Pakistan (Bangladesh split in 1971); the Soviet Union
(creation in 1922; dissolution in 1991); Sudan (South Sudan split in 2011);
Vietnam (1945-1953 period and reunification in 1976); Yemen (unification in
1990); Yugoslavia (1991 breakup). Setting \code{prefer_successor} to \code{TRUE}
ensures the successor state is the only measurement included, where the
successor state is preferentially the state in the Gleditsch-Ward system.
Setting it to \code{FALSE} ensures both measurements are included, which results
in two measurements for the same country-year (where country means the
country in \code{extended_country_name}).}

\item{fix_PIPE}{The \link{PIPE} dataset uses a particularly tangled state system,
measuring some countries when they should not exist, or splitting some
countries into historical and modern states but measuring both during the
historical period:\tabular{llrr}{
   extended_country_name \tab PIPE_country \tab min_year \tab max_year \cr
   Austria \tab Austria \tab 1918 \tab 1918 \cr
   Austria \tab Austria-Hungary (Austria) \tab 1918 \tab 1918 \cr
   Austria-Hungary \tab Austria-Hungary (Austria) \tab 1848 \tab 1917 \cr

   Korea \tab North Korea \tab 1820 \tab 1870 \cr
   Korea \tab South Korea \tab 1820 \tab 1870 \cr
   Pakistan \tab Pakistan \tab 1950 \tab 1970 \cr

   Turkey (Ottoman Empire) \tab Ottoman Empire \tab 1820 \tab 1913 \cr
   Turkey (Ottoman Empire) \tab Turkey \tab 1820 \tab 1913 \cr
   Vietnam, Democratic Republic of \tab Vietnam \tab 1954 \tab 1975 \cr

   Yugoslavia \tab Serbia And Montenegro \tab 1991 \tab 1991 \cr
   Yugoslavia \tab Yugoslavia \tab 1990 \tab 1991 \cr
}


Some of these are fixed by setting \code{prefer_successor} to \code{TRUE} (the default)
but others do not make much sense. \code{fix_PIPE = TRUE} (the default) deletes
Austria-Hungary entirely (as there is no principled choice about which half
to retain); removes the Czech Republic from the period 1990-1992; removes
North and South Korea from the 19th century; assumes Pakistan from 1950-1970
must include Bangladesh, and Turkey from 1820-1913 refers to the Ottoman
Empire; removes unified Vietnam from the period 1954-1975, Serbia from 1990,
and Serbia and Montenegro from 1990 to 1991 (leaving only Yugoslabia from
1990 to 1991).}

\item{enforce_GW_enddates}{This enforces the Gleditsch-Ward enddates of
historical states, so they are not measured after their dissolution. This
only affects a limited number of entities: Tibet (ends in 1950),
Czechoslovakia (ends in 1992), Gran Colombia (ends in 1831; Polity measures
it until 1832), the Vatican (identified with the Papal States, ends in 1870)
and Zanzibar (ends in 1964). The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{target_system}{Character vector describing which state system to use
for the combined file, and which country codes to use. Can be one or both
of "GWn" (Gleditsch and Ward, numeric codes) and "cown" (numeric codes for
the Correlates of War system). The default is \emph{both} Gleditsch-ward and
Correlates of War (\code{c("GWn", "cown")}).}
}
\value{
A \link{tibble} with the selected democracy measures and state system
information, in two versions: "long" and "wide". These contain the
following variables:
}
\description{
This function automates the process of joining together all the archived and
downloadable datasets in this package, producing a comprehensive data frame
with every democracy measure. It automatically converts each democracy
measure to a numeric value, ensures that larger values are associated with
more democracy, and that all country-years are appropriately matched.
}
\section{Standard descriptive variables (generated by this package)}{

\describe{

\item{extended_country_name}{The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. & Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at
\url{http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html}.}

\item{GWn}{Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code, from the Gleditsch and
Ward list of independent states.}

\item{cown}{The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
\url{http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership} for
the full list.}

\item{in_GW_system}{Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is \code{FALSE} because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
\code{TRUE} for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.} }
}

\section{Long version}{


In the "long" version of the dataset (\code{output_format = "long"}), the
output data frame also contains the following variables:

\describe{

\item{year}{The calendar year. Most measures of democracy reflect the
country's situation as of 31 December of the year. If
\code{keep_last_in_year = FALSE} (and \code{format = "long"}), a single
country year may nevertheless contain more than one measurement for some
measures (e.g., \link{prc}).}

\item{measure}{The name of the measure. (e.g., "blm", "fh_total_reversed").
}

\item{variable}{The numerical value of the measure, in the original scale
(if \code{scale_scores = FALSE}) or as a z-score (if \code{scale_scores =
  TRUE}).}

\item{index_type}{The index type (dichotomous, trichotomous,
ordinal/graded, continuous).}

\item{dataset}{The name of the dataset.} }
}

\section{Wide version}{


In the "wide" version of the dataset (\code{output_format = "wide"}), the
output data frame can also contain any of the following variables (in the
scales described below, unless \code{scale_scores = TRUE}, in which case
the measures are converted to z-scores):

\describe{

\item{year}{The calendar year. In the "wide" version, all  measures of
democracy reflect the country's situation as of 31 December of the year as
much as possible.}

\item{anckar_democracy}{The \link{anckar} measure of democracy, as a numeric
value. Up to 2010 this should be identical to \code{bmr_democracy_omitteddata}.
0 = non-democracy, 1 = democracy.}

\item{arat}{The original \link{arat} measure of democracy, converted to numeric
form. Ranges from 29 (least democratic) to 109 (most democratic). See
\link{arat} for details.}

\item{anrr_democracy}{The \link{anrr} measure of democracy, as a numeric value.
0 = non-democracy, 1 = democracy.}

\item{blm}{The \link{blm} measure of democracy, as a numeric value. Can be 0
(authoritarian), 0.5 (hybrid), or 1 (democracy). }

\item{bmr_democracy}{The \link{bmr} measure of democracy, as a numeric value.
Can be 0 (non-democracy) or 1 (democracy). }

\item{bmr_democracy_omitteddata}{According to the \link{bmr} codebook, "this is
the same measure as bmr, except it records an NA for countries occupied
during an international war (e.g., the Netherlands 1940-44) or experiencing
state collapse during a civil war (e.g., Lebanon 1976-89). The democracy
variable instead fills in these years as continuations of the same regime
type." There are some -1 values that I've converted to \code{NA} (the measure is
supposed to be between 0 and 1).}

\item{bmr_democracy_femalesuffrage}{According to the \link{bmr} codebook, this
is the same measure as \code{bmr}, except that it also requires that at least
half of adult women have the right to vote. 30 countries change values.}

\item{bnr}{The \link{bnr} event measure of democracy, reversed, so that 0
indicates non-democracy and 1 indicates democracy. Since the \code{event}
variable of the \link{bnr} dataset only codes terminations of democracy
(ignoring years when the country is non-democratic), this variable is
mostly equal to 1.}

\item{bnr_extended}{The \link{bnr_extended} variable, with 0 indicating
non-democracy and 1 indicating democracy. See the documentation for
\link{bnr_extended} for details of how this variable extends \link{bnr}, filling in
years of non-democracy back to 1913.}

\item{bti}{The \link{bti} - Berteslmann Transformation Democracy Status index.
Ranges from 1 to 10. }

\item{doorenspleet}{The \link{doorenspleet} measure of democracy, with 1
indicating non-democracy and 2 indicating democracy.}

\item{eiu}{The \link{eiu} measure of democracy, ranging from 0 (least
democratic) to 10 (most democratic). The report says that the index "is
based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties;
the functioning of government; political participation; and political
culture" which form "one interrelated whole"}

\item{fh_electoral}{The \link{fh_electoral} measure of electoral democracy, with
0 indicating a lack of electoral democracy, 1 indicating electoral
democracy status.}

\item{fh_total_reversed}{The \href{fh}{Freedom House} combined measure of
political and civil rights, reversed, so that 0 is least free and 12 is
most free.}

extended to the period before 1945 for some countries.}

\item{gwf_democracy_strict}{A measure of democracy from \link{gwf_all}, obtained
by coding all democracies as 1 and all non-democracies as 0.  It is
\code{NA} for all non-democratic non-autocracies (e.g., warlord regimes,
foreign occupation, etc.).}

\item{gwf_democracy_extended_strict}{A measure of democracy from
\link{gwf_all_extended}, obtained by coding all democracies as 1 and all
non-democracies as 0. It is \code{NA} for all non-democratic

documentation for \link{gwf_all_extended} for details on how the dataset was
extended to the period before 1945 for some countries.}

\item{kailitz_binary}{A measure of democracy from \link{kailitz}, obtained by
coding all liberal democracies as 1 and all other regimes as 0.}

\item{kailitz_tri}{A trichotomous measure of democracy from \link{kailitz},

\section{State-system choices}{


State system choices are not always straightforward or clear. Most
democracy datasets use some version of the Correlates of War system of
states, though not consistently or entirely correctly (which is why this
package uses \link{country_year_coder}). There are a number of alternatives,
including the Gleditsch and Ward system, the Polity system (both based on
the COW system, with some modifications), and the V-Dem system (wich is at
the basis of \link{LIED}, though \link{LIED} also draws on the idiosyncratic \link{PIPE}
system). Freedom House and VaPoReg also develop their own panel of states,
including many units considered non-sovereign by others. I have opted for
maximal coverage (including all non-sovereign units), with three
exceptions.

First, the default is to prefer the successor state where a country-year
unit is measured twice in a single year (for the precursor and the
successor state). This setting affects Ethiopia (Eritrea split in 1993);
Germany (reunification in 1993); Italy (unification in 1861, previously
Piedmont-Sardinia); Pakistan (Bangladesh split in 1971); the Soviet Union
(creation in 1922; dissolution in 1991); Sudan (South Sudan split in 2011);
Vietnam (1945-1953 period and reunification in 1976); Yemen (unification in
1990); Yugoslavia (1991 breakup). Use \code{prefer_successor = FALSE} to
override.

Second, the default is to delete various entities in the \link{PIPE} dataset
that are measured before their appearance as states (e.g., North and South
Korea in the 19th century). To keep these entities, use \code{fix_PIPE = FALSE}.

Finally, whenever there is more than one measurement per year, I keep only
the last one (as far as I can determine it); use \code{keep_only_last_in_year = FALSE} to override. I also keep the last year for no longer existing
entities, but delete any subsequent years (if they appear). Thus the
following entities should have no observations in the years after their
dissolution:\tabular{lllr}{

}


As noted, Korea and Vietnam do contain observations for years after their
exit from the system of states in the Gleditsch and Ward panel in 1910 and
1893, respectively, since they have extant successors and are measured by
some datasets for those periods:\tabular{lll}{
   extended_country_name \tab panel \tab dissolution_date \cr
   Korea \tab GWn \tab 1910-08-22 \cr
   Vietnam (Annam/Cochin China/Tonkin) \tab GWn \tab 1893-01-01 \cr
}


The treatment of Palestine is also complicated. Several datasets (e.g.,
\link{vdem}, \link{fh}, and \link{LIED}) contain separate measurements for the West Bank and
Gaza; \link{fh} includes the West Bank, Gaza, and "Israeli-Occupied Territories"
(I'm assuming the occupied territories in Lebanon and Syria). I've labeled
them as follows:\tabular{lllrr}{

   British Mandate of Palestine \tab Palestine \tab vaporeg \tab 1919 \tab 1947 \cr

There are some other oddities, primarily concerning \link{fh} and the \link{polity} and
Polity-derived datasets such as \link{pitf}. \link{fh} includes a measure for the
"Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"; I've left it as is
(\code{extended_country_name = "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}, not
allocated to either Ukraine or Russia). And \link{polity} includes separate
observations for both Russia 1922 and USSR 1922; I've excluded the USSR 1922
observation since it officially began on 31 December 1922.

Note also that though I've kept Germany 1945 (COW code 255, per the table
above, since it ends in 1945 in the Gleditsch-Ward panel), there are
observations for the (occupied) territory of both the later German Federal
Republic and the later German Democratic Republic in 1945.
