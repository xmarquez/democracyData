Downloads the 2024 update of the Freedom House Freedom in the World All Data
2013-2024 file and processes it using \link{country_year_coder}. The original data

\section{Standard descriptive variables (generated by this package)}{

\describe{

\item{extended_country_name}{The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. & Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at
\url{http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html}.}

\item{GWn}{Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code, from the Gleditsch and
Ward list of independent states.}

\item{cown}{The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
\url{http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership} for
the full list.}

\item{in_GW_system}{Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is \code{FALSE} because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
\code{TRUE} for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.} }

\section{Methodological notes}{


From FH's Freedom in the World methodology discussion:

Methodological changes have been effected periodically. For discussions of
these changes, please consult the methodology essays for various editions
of the survey.

For a full explanation of the current methodology, please consult the most
recent edition of the survey.

"PR" stands for "Political Rights," "CL" stands for "Civil Liberties," and
"Status" is the Freedom Status. Political Rights and Civil Liberties are
measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree
of Freedom and seven the lowest.

Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights
and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated "Free";
between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free," and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free."
Beginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average
ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free," and those between 5.5
and 7.0 are "Not Free."

Several countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or
merged with a neighboring state. Scores for these countries are given only
for the period of their existence as independent states.
