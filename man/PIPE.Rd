\section{Credits}{
 The data were originally collected by Tamar Asadurian,
Anjali Thomas Bohlken, Carolina Curvale, and Sunny Kuniyathu. They went
through several rounds of revisions and additions with the participation of
Jenny Guardado, Jean Hong, Sebastian Lavezzolo, Kristin Michelitch, Yingying
Na, Lindsay Schorr Newman, S.K. Park, Didac Queralt, Gonzalo Rivero, Kong
Joo Shin, Tolga Sinmazdemir, and Tianyang Xi. Pablo Barbera, Jeff Carnegie,
Sonke Ehret, Omar Garcia-Ponce, Jaeyoun Jung, Yu Jeon Park, and Pedro Silva
additionally checked some countries. To catch discrepancies, some variables
were checked against other data compilations. No other data source, however,
was used in its original form. The discrepancies that remain are due either
to deffinitional differences or to a different assessment of facts.
}

\section{Introduction}{


The data set is intended to cover all countries that were or would become
independent at any time after 1917, each from the inception of the first
representative institutions or from the date of independence, whichever
comes first, through 2008. The rows of the data matrix contain information
for countries during years.

In general, whenever the relevant situation may change during the year,
recorded is the status as of December 31. For example, if a country had a
legislature during some parts of a particular year but the legislature was
closed at the end of the year, it is coded as closed for this year. Other
variables, however, either count the frequency of particular events during a
particular year (for example, the number of chief executives) or are country
invariant. The code -1 generically refers to situations in which a
particular variable is not applicable. This coding is not always consistent:
sometimes in such situations data are recorded as missing, for example,
presidential elections in countries where there are no presidents.

\section{Shell}{


Note: Some countries had convoluted histories: (1) They became independent,
lost independence by being annexed by another country or by joining a
federation, and then became independent again. (2) They split and became
unified again. (3) They emerged from collapse of empires or from splits from
another country. (4) They resulted from unification of previously
independent or separate units. Our general rule is to keep as the same over
time countries under (1) and (2) but to treat as new countries those under
(3) and (4). The Baltic republics are an example of (1), Germany is a case
of (2), Serbia, which split from Yugoslavia together with Macedonia and then
from Macedonia illustrates (3), while post-1975 Vietnam is a case of (4).

Some countries belonged at some times to other countries. For example, the
Czech Republic, which became independent as of 1993, was a part of the
Austrio-Hungarian Empire before 1918 and of Czechoslovakia between 1918 and
1992. We refer as "supra-units" to those units that contained at least one
territory that would become independent at any time after 1917 and as
"parts" to those units that composed them. The supra-units need not be
independent: British India is an example. Colonial empires are not
considered as supra-units and they are coded as such separately.

\describe{

\item{PIPE_countryn}{The name of the country at the time. This has been
partially reconstructed. The original data was missing many names, and did
not use a consistent scheme for naming countries. Use \code{extended_country_name}
instead.}

\item{country_number}{The number of the country. Note: For historical
reasons the numbering of countries is haphazard. Countries with numbers less
than 142 are arranged alphabetically within regions but the remaining
countries are not. This will be corrected in a future version.}

\item{PIPE_cowcodes}{The number of the country in the Correlates of War (COW)
data set. This has been reconstructed. The original data was missing several
cowcodes.}

\item{year}{The calendar year.}

\item{id}{A unique observation identifier, concatenation of
\code{country}+\code{year}. For example, Turkey is country 125 and in 1900
its \code{id} is 1251900.}

\item{id2}{Identifies a particular observation by the number of a supra-unit
of which it is a part and year. For example, in 1900 Turkey was part of the
Ottoman Empire, the \code{id} of which is 540, so that \code{id2} for Turkey
in this year is 5401900. This \code{id} is shared among all constituent
parts of the Ottoman Empire in 1900. If a territory is not part of a
supra-unit, then \code{id2}=\code{id}.}

\item{id3}{Identifies a particular observation by the number of the country
of which the territory is a dependency. For example, in 1900 Kenya was a
dependency of the United Kingdom, which is country 126, so ID3 for Kenya for
the year 1900 is 1261900 If a territory is not a dependency, then
ID3=\code{id2}.}

\item{supra}{Identifies the supra-unit of which a particular unit is a part
during a particular year. Thus, \code{supra}=540 for all parts of the
Ottoman Empire. \code{supra} is coded only if \code{id} != \code{id2};
otherwise, it is coded as missing. Note that this implies that \code{supra}
is coded as missing for the supra-units themselves.}

\item{yrindep}{is the year during which a country became independent. For
countries that were independent before year 1000 the date is set arbitrarily
at 1000. In case of entities that became unified, coded is the year of
unification. For countries that temporarily lost independence having been
annexed to other countries, the most recent date of independence is given.
For units that never became independent as such (West African Federation,
Leeward Islands Federation), the code is -1.}

\item{polstatus}{Current political status of the country. Coded as: -1 Does
not exist as a separate country 0 Dependency 1 Independent, not colonizer 2
Colonizer Note: The code -1 is used to keep rows of countries that were
independent, lost independence or split, and then reappeared, in fact some
of the Soviet Republics and Germany. Only occupations of territories lasting
longer than ten years are considered as constituting colonial rule. For
example, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia is not considered as colonial.}

\item{occupied}{Dummy for country years during which a territory was
occupied by a foreign power, as long as this power controlled central
government (until the first election of the national government) or occupied
the capital. The variable does not apply to metropolitan rule in
dependencies. Countries that are annexed to another country (for example,
Baltic republics in 1940) are not occupied. Note: A country can be a colony
and occupied only if the occupier is distinct from the colonial power, for
example, Japan in the Dutch colony of Indonesia. Coded as of December 31, so
that occupations that begin and end within the same year are ignored.} }
}

\section{Constitutional Framework}{


\describe{

\item{const_onpaper}{The year in which the most recent constitution was
promulgated, whether or not it was implemented. Even if a constitution is
extensively modified by amendments, it remains the same unless a new
constitution is formally adopted or the old constitution is formally
abrogated without being replaced. This variable is coded as 0 if there is no
constitution, it is coded as -1 if there is more than one constitution.

Note: Constitutions are defined nominally, that is, a document is a
constitution if it is called that. Sometimes there are several acts that
together constitute a constitution: if they have different dates, we use the
one that regulates the selection of the chief executive. Documents called
"Instructions of government" or the like are included if they regulate the
selection of the chief executive.

The frequency with which constitutions change differs greatly across
countries. For example, Dominican Republic had thirty-three constitutions
between 1844 and 1995, in part because every time a constitution was in any
way amended, the modified document was called a new constitution. In
contrast, Sweden changed basic provisions concerning the composition of the
legislature, franchise, and parliamentary responsibility without formally
recognizing any of these changes as a new constitution until 1975. Hence,
the constitutions coded here are not equivalent units. The "English
Constitution" was a combination of written rules (collected for the first
time between 1769 and 1777 at the instigation of the House of Lords), legal
precedents, informal norms, and unstated habits, but ever before its first
description by De Lolme in 1771, it was recognized as a stable for of
organization of government. We date it, somewhat arbitrarily, to 1688. We
also attribute this date to pre-1964 Barbados. In the case of Israel, we use
the year of first basic law, 1958.}

\item{const_inforce}{ The year in which the constitution in force by the end
of a year was promulgated. A constitution is in force whenever its
provisions concerning the selection of the chief executive or of the
legislature (if any) are implemented. This variable equals
\code{const_onpaper} except that it is coded as 0 if: (1) If a constitution
was never implemented (the French Constitution of 1793, the 1976
Constitution of the Central African Republic), (2) If a constitution
provides for an elected chief executive and/or the legislature and all such
provisions are violated.

Note: The reason to use such de facto rules is that the legal status of the
constitution is sometimes difficult to determine. For example, the Junta
headed by General Ongania in Argentina in 1966 deposed the president and the
vicepresident, dissolved the Congress, and banished political parties, while
adopting Statutes of the Argentine Revolution as an organic document
regulating the operation of the government, all seemingly without any
reference to the Constitution of 1853 (Floria and Belsunce 1988: 193). Even
more nuanced were the years 1973-76 in Chile, where views as to whether the
Constitution of 1925 remained in force were divided even among advisors of
the military Junta. Only by 1976, the Junta passed Constitutional Acts, thus
effectively abrogating the previous constitution and only in 1980 a new
constitution was adopted (Barros 2002). Some constitutions do not provide
for any kind of elections. In such cases the constitution is considered to
be in force as long as its other provisions are observed. There are also
frequent cases in which a constitution is implemented only several years
after it is adopted: for example, the first elections under the 1974
Constitution of Mali took place only in 1979. In such cases, the
constitution is considered to be in effect even before it is implemented.
This rule applies anew each time a constitution is reinstated. The coding of
constitutions in force is conservative, in the sense that a constitution is
considered to be in force if it provides for an election for both the chief
executive and a legislature and only one of them is elected. A more
stringent coding can be constructed by recoding constitutions as not being
in force if either the chief executive or the legislature is not elected.
Note, however, that even if one of these actors is not currently elected, it
may be elected during subsequent years still under the same constitutions.

Here is a list of constitutions that did not provide for an elected chief
executive or legislature:

1975 Angola: the legislative organ (council of the revolution) performed
both executive and legislative functions; hence, it was not counted as a
legislature. The head of the MPLA was the chief executive; he was not
elected.

1969 Congo (Brazaville): did not provide for a legislature.

1951 Nepal: chief executive is the monarch and there is no elected
legislature.

1865 Mexico: sovereignty vested in emperor, no elected legislature.

1884 British Honduras: crown colony, no elected legislature.

1865 Jamaica: crown colony, no elected legislature.

1939 Albania: executive power vested in the King and exercised by the King's
viceroy. Legislative power was vested in the King, and a Superior Fascist
Corporative Council appointed to assist the Crown.} }
}

\section{Organization of Government}{


Note: Constitutional provisions are coded as provided for in the
constitutions, that is, according to \code{const_onpaper}, even if the
constitution is not observed (\code{const_inforce}=0) or if it has fallen
into disuse or was never used. For example, the last royal veto occurred in
England in 1706 and the last unilateral dissolution in 1834 but because no
legal acts were passed to curtail these royal prerogatives they are coded as
present.

\describe{

\item{title_ce}{ Title of the nominal head of government (chief executive,
as distinct from the head of state), according to the constitution.
Nominating and dismissing powers are not executive powers. Presiding over
meetings of the council of ministers or promulgating laws are also not
considered executive powers. These rules apply even if these powers are
specified in a section of constitution that deals with executive powers.

-1 if there is no constitution or more than one

0 if monarch or governor general (if the constitution states that the
monarch is the chief executive)

1 if prime minister (president of the government or equivalent)

2 if president who cannot be removed in good behavior during a fixed term,
whether directly or indirectly elected,

3 if the constitution gives executive powers both to president, who cannot
be removed during a fixed term, and to a prime minister. Typically, such
constitutions enumerate specific powers of the president and reserve the
remaining powers for the government.

4 if collective,

5 if other.

Note: Coded mechanically as 0 for the British colonies. Chief executive is
coded as collective even if one person bears the title of the president of
the collective body, say military junta, but not of the country.}

\item{dissolution_power}{ Dummy for the power of the head of state to
dissolve the legislature (at least the lower house) unilaterally. 0 if never
unilaterally. 1 if a unilateral (that is, not at the request of someone
else) decision of the dissolver.

Note: Dissolution power is unilateral if the head of state can dissolve the
parliament without the consent of the government or leaders of political
parties in the legislature. It is still unilateral if dissolution requires
the consultation or consent of non-elected bodies or if there are
restrictions concerning the frequency or the period during which it can
occur.}

\item{leg_composition}{Captures legal provisions regulating the mode of
selection of the lower house of the legislature. Whenever there are no such
provisions but a legislature exists, the actual mode of selection is coded.
These provisions are coded whether or not the legislature in fact exists, as
long as they have not been formally abrogated or suspended.

Rows distinguish elected vs. appointed legislatures. Ex-officio members are
considered as appointed. Columns specify whether or not there are distinct
electorates (whether people living next to each other vote for the same
seats) and/or whether the appointed seats are distributed among some
categories.

The coding entails two levels. At the first level, as represented by
integers, we indicate whether the legislature was fully appointed, partially
appointed and partially elected, or fully elected, and whether either those
appointed or the voters were distinguished according to some criteria. In
cases of partly elected and partly appointed legislatures, the first decimal
indicates whether distinctions apply to the electorate or to the appointed
position. In cases where at least some members are appointed, the second
decimal provides information whether appointments resulted from delegation
from below or nomination from above. Thus, for example, in Austria between
1848 and 1877, voters were divided into curiae according to property
criteria: we code this case as 10. In Jordan, the legislature was elected
except for two seats reserved for Bedouins, who were appointed: the code is
7.01 since the legislature was partially appointed (7) and the
representatives were nominated from above (0.01). Finally, in Fiji in 1929,
Europeans and Indo-Fijians were elected by separate electorates, while
Fijians were appointed by the chiefs: we code is as 7.12 since the
legislature was partially appointed (7), the distinction by race/ethnicity
applied to voters (0.1), and the appointed representatives were delegates
(0.02). We ignore functional bodies such as in Yugoslavia 1974 and therefore
code them as missing. If there is a functional body along with territorial
body, we focus on the latter. Quotas, such as that some proportion of the
legislature must be female, are not considered unless there are separate
electorates for male and female seats. The codes for particular categories
are represented by cell entries in the table (table cannot be reproduced
properly here - consult online codebook at
\url{https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/adam-przeworski/home/data}):

None Income, Race Both Property, Ethnicity Profession Religion Estate Gender
None 0 0 0 0 Fully appointed& 1 2 3 4 Partly appointed 5& 6& 7& 8& Fully
elected 9 10 11 12

None means that there are no constitutional provisions for a legislature and
no legislature in fact.
\itemize{
\item Accompanied by a decimal as follows: 0.1 if distinctions apply to the
electorate 0.2 if distinctions apply to the appointed positions 0.3 if
distinctions apply both to the electorate and the appointed positions
}

& Accompanied by a centecimal as follows: 0.01 appointed from above 0.02
appointed from below 0.03 some are appointed from above and some are
appointed from below

In addition to these codes, assemblies based on estate representation are
coded as 13. Estate assemblies were bodies divided into three of more
chambers, each of which contained representatives (or indeed all members
appearing personally) of one, and only one, legally privileged status group
or estate such as the nobility, the clergy, and the burghers of the
self-governing towns. (Ertman 1997: 21) An estate, in turn, may be defined
as a group of people having the same status in the sense in which that word
is used by lawyers. A status in this sense is a position to which is
attached a bundle of rights and duties, privileges and obligations, legal
capacities and incapacities, which are publicly recognized and which can be
defined and enforced by public authority and in many cases by courts of law.
(Marshall 1965: 193). For a discussion of the Estate system, see Poggi
(1978: Chapter 3).}

\item{bicam}{ Number of houses of the legislature: 0 if none, 1, 2, 3. A
legislature that is elected in one election and then divides itself into
chambers that differ in some prerogatives and at least at times vote
separately is coded as multicameral. An example is Norway as of 1814.}

\item{upper_house}{Composition of the legislature. 0 if unicameral, 1 if
second (upper) house is fully elected (directly or not), 2 if second (upper)
house is partially appointed, 3 if second (upper) house is fully appointed
or hereditary.}

\item{upper_block}{Indicates whether the second (upper) house can delay or
veto the decisions of the first (lower) house. -1 if the legislature is
unicameral, 0 if the second (upper) house cannot block or delay legislation
passed by the lower (first) house, 1 if the second (upper) house can only
put a suspensive veto or can send for reconsideration (a "suspensive veto"
is any veto that can be overridden by someone), 2 if the second (upper)
house must approve must legislation or can put a final veto. Note: Blocking
applies to any issue area. Note that if \code{upper_house}= 1 AND
\code{upper_block} =1, then non-elective legislative power can block.}

\item{outside_block}{Indicates whether anyone outside the legislature, other
than courts, can block legislation. 0 if no one cannot suspend or block
legislation, 1 if someone can put a suspensive veto, that is, a veto subject
to override, 2 if someone can put derogative veto.}

\item{blocker}{ Indicates whether the blocker is elected. -1 if no blocker 0
if not elected (including partially elected blockers) 1 if elected
(individuals or bodies appointed by an elected body are considered to be
elected)} }
}

\section{Organization of elections}{


\describe{ \item{f}{Franchise. Qualifications for the right to vote in
national elections. Preliminary notes: To account for exclusions not
captured under \code{f}, we use the variable \code{oth_exclusions} (see
below).

There are cases of coexisting qualifications. We handle them as follows:

(1) If the qualifications differ by ethnicity or religion (common in
colonies), we code the least restrictive qualification for non-colonizers.

(2) If the qualifications are set at a sub-national level, we code the
variable as missing. (Unified countries in which franchise is regulated by
sub-units include the United States, Mexico, or South Africa before 1968,
while cases of countries that were not yet politically unified include
Argentina before 1853, South Africa before 1910, and Australia before 1901).
Regulations concerning immigrants and foreign residents are not considered.

Coding of franchise:

missing before suffrage was instituted for the first time.

The codes 0 to 7 are for males only:

0 No legal provisions for suffrage. This code is applied (a) whenever
constitutions or other legal acts providing for suffrage were either
abrogated without being replaced or formally suspended, (b) if (a) is
unclear, whenever the legislature was closed and neither legislative nor
presidential elections were held.

1 Estate representation. Example: Sweden until 1866.

2 Property only.

3 (Property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of profession OR educational
titles) AND literacy.

4 Property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of profession OR educational
titles. This code applies whenever the law specifies a minimum threshold,
even if this threshold is very low (for example, tax contribution of three
days of local wages in France in 1789, as long as this requirement is
observed. If it is not observed, as in post-1917 Mexico, the code is 6.

5 Literacy only OR (Literacy OR property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of
profession OR educational titles). 6 All the economically independent (not
personal servants, not debtors, only residence requirement). Includes: (a)
phrases that explicitly refer to economic independence. Example: "Tener una
propiedad, o ejercer cualquiera profesión, o arte con título público, u
ocuparse en alguna industria útil, sin sujeción a otro en clase de sirviente
o jornalero." (Peru in 1823) (b) phrases such as known means of subsistence,
"honest livelihood." Example: "Son ciudadanos todos los habitantes de la
Republica naturales de pais o naturalizados en el que fueren casados, o
mayores de diez y ocho anos, siempre que exerzan alguna profesion util o
tengan medios conocidos de subsistencia." (Costa Rica 1824) (c) phrases that
suggest clearly broad qualifications. Example: "Son ciudadanos todos los
salvadoreños mayores de veintiún años que sean padres de familia, o cabezas
de casa, o que sepan leer y escribir, o que tengan la propiedad que designa
la ley." (El Salvador 1841) (d) cases where suffrage is universal but only
for free men (i.e., not slaves) (e) cases that fall under 4 without explicit
thresholds. Examples: Romania 1866, Peru 1860. The French constitutions of
1795 and 1799 required "une contribution quelquonque." The 1860 Peruvian
constitution qualified anyone who could read and write OR paid any taxes OR
owned a workshop OR owned some land. The last provision was intended to
allow the indigenous population to vote. (f) cases in which franchise is
declared to be universal but excludes those who have failed to pay taxes or
those permanently receiving public assistance or those under legal
bankruptcy.

7 All ("Manhood"). The only exclusions admitted in this category are: (1)
having been convicted of a crime (2) being legally incompetent (3) short,
less than two-year local residence requirement. There are some cases,
however, where the law contains restrictive phrases, such as the requirement
of appearing on the tax rolls or having fulfilled military obligation, these
restrictions were not enforced. In such cases franchise was coded as 7. An
example is the Ottoman Constitution of 1876 (in force after 1908) or the
Swedish law until 1975.

For females, we use the second digit, distinguishing only situations in
which

0 if no women can vote

1 women are qualified on narrower basis than males Examples: (a) in England
between 1918 and 1927 males were qualified at the age of 20, females at 25.
(b) in Canada between 1917 and 1920 the vote was given only to relatives of
military. (c) in some countries women voted only in some regions. Note that
if females vote in municipal elections, we do not include it since the codes
refer only to national elections.

2 women are qualified on the same basis as males.

Auxiliary codes: -1 More than one constitution, any other kind of political
chaos that makes the electoral rules inoperative. For years of foreign
occupation we either set as missing or extend the restriction in effect
before the occupation. -2 Family representation (Bhutan).}

\item{first_digit}{The first digit of \code{f}.}

\item{second_digit}{The second digit of \code{f}.}

\item{ext_type}{Type of franchise extension during a particular year. Coded
as: -1 if contraction 0 if no extension 1 if suffrage was extended by class
(that is, the first digit of \code{f} increased) 2 if suffrage was extended
by gender (that is, the second digit of \code{f} increased) 3 if suffrage
was extended both by class and gender (that is, both digits increased).

Notes: Cases in which franchise changed from f>0 to f=0, whether because
there was no constitution or the new constitution did not provide for
elections are not coded as contractions. There are cases in which new
franchise provisions are adopted but do not enter in force in the subsequent
election. An example is Sweden, which adopted universal suffrage in 1919 but
did not apply it in the election of 1920, only in 1921. In such cases
\code{ext_type} is coded for the year of election when the new provision was
applied. *** How is it coded if (1) The country/dependency existed but had
no franchise, (2) The country is new but had franchise as a dependency or a
part?}

\item{oth_exclusions}{Captures exclusions not accounted for under \code{f}.
Coded as follows: 0 None other (all restrictions are accounted for under
\code{f}).

1 By ethnicity (some ethnic groups are excluded).

2 By territory (people living in some regions cannot vote).

3 By religion (only adherents of a particular religion(s) can vote).

4 By politics (Individuals sympathizing with some political parties or
ideologies are excluded. This code refers only to persons, hence it does not
cover cases when political parties are banned.). Includes the language in
which suffrage is determined by moral character.

5 Slaves are excluded.

6 Military personnel or police is excluded.

7 Priests or nuns are excluded.

8 Propertied are excluded (as in Mongolia, USSR 1918).

Note: When more than one exclusion applies, all are listed as consecutive
digits. For example, if 5, 6, and 7 applies, we code exclusions as 567.}

\item{franchise_age}{Age at which those otherwise qualified to vote can
exercise this right. Whenever age thresholds are different for different
groups, lowest age is coded, unless the group which can vote at an earlier
age is very small, say holders of Legion d'Honneur in post-1946 France.}

\item{secret}{Secrecy of the vote in legislative elections. 0 Open, public 1
Secret 2 Secret optional 3 Public for some, secret for others. Note: There
were few observation coded as 2 or 3 and they have been collapsed with 1 in
the data file. The original data do exist.}

\item{compulsory}{Refers to voting any national level elections. 0 Optional
1 Compulsory}

\item{presdirect}{Mode of election of the president in popular elections. 0
Indirect. The president is chosen by electors, elected specifically for the
purpose of selecting the president (not by the parliament). 1 Direct 2 Some
voters vote directly, some indirectly, depending on individual
characteristics 3 Some voters vote directly, some indirectly, depending on
collective characteristics (i.e. territory)

Note: Cases in which the constitution provides that the president is elected
by the legislature, including those in which the legislature elects only if
none of the candidates obtains some minimum threshold of votes, are coded
according to the provisions concerning popular elections, that is, such
provisions do not make the mode of election indirect. There were few
observation coded as 2 or 3 and they have been collapsed as 2 in the data
file. The original data do exist.}

\item{legdirect}{Mode of election of the legislature. Refers only to the

indirectly, depending on individual characteristics 3 Some voters vote
directly, some indirectly, depending on collective characteristics (i.e.
territory)

collapsed with 1 in the data file. The original data do exist.}

\item{presterm}{Constitutionally prescribed duration of the chief
executive's tenure (in years). -1 if no term is specified 0 if life term

Note: If the term of the president is extended while an incumbent is in
office, it changes in the year it was extended.}

\item{legterm}{Constitutionally prescribed duration of the legislative term
in the lower house (in years). -1 if no term is specified 0 if life term

0 unlimited number of consecutive terms 1 out after 1 term, can never come
back 2 out after 1 term, can come back 3 out after more than one term, can
come back 4 out after more than one term, can never come back.}}

\describe{

\item{exselec}{Dummy for the chief executive having been elected (whether
directly or indirectly; indirectly means elected by people who have been
elected; if indirectly elected, election by a partly elected body counts as
being elected). In cases of death, constitutional successors of elected
chief executives are coded as elected. Coded is each year of the current
chief executive. Prime ministers are always coded as elected as long as the
legislature is open (\code{openl}=1). If there is a president and a prime
minister, \code{exselec}=1 only if both have been elected. If a chief
executive is elected, overthrown by force, and then reinstated, coded as of
the year of reinstatement.}

\item{legselec}{Dummy for the lower house of the legislature having been at
least partly elected. (Coded as 1 if \code{openl}=1 and
\code{leg_composition}= 5)}

\item{openl}{A dummy variable for the existence of a legislature. A
legislature is a body that (1) issues at least some laws and (2) does not
perform executive functions. Legislative Councils which advise the ruler but
have no authority to proclaim laws are not considered legislatures. Military
Juntas that issue legal acts but also perform executive functions are
disqualified by the second criterion.}

\item{legparty}{Number of parties in the legislature. By "party" we take
here any recognizable, named grouping, regardless whether and how they
appeared in elections. This variable is coded regardless whether the
legislature was elected or appointed. -1 if no legislature, 0 if none
(including cases where parties are officially banned), 1 if one (including
cases where other parties are officially banned), 2 if more.

Note: During the early period candidates typically competed in elections on
an individual basis, without any kind of centralized party organizations or
shared programs. Within legislatures, however, they often coalesced into
groups, currents, factions, "sentiments," etc. Hence, subjective judgments
are inevitable in coding this variable. Our rule of thumb was to code as
parties any kind of groups that bore a label that survived over two
consecutive legislatures. This was true in several countries of "Liberals"
and "Conservatives." In other countries, notably France between 1815 and
1848, however, the divisive issues, the parliamentary groups, and their
labels changed frequently, and such cases are coded as "none." A legislature
consisting of one party and independents is coded as one party.}

\item{opposition}{This variable is intended to indicate whether the
institutional system allows at least some political pluralism. 1 if as of
December 31 there is a legislature that was at least in part elected by
voters facing more than one choice.

Note: Even if the legislature consisted of multiple parties but in the
election all the candidates were presented to voters on the same, single
list, we consider that voters had no choice. If there was only one party
while some candidates ran as independents, we also regard it as a situation
in which there was no partisan pluralism. If parties were banned and
everyone ran as independent, there is no opposition (see Swaziland). If,
however, parties were not banned and everyone ran without party labels, then
we regard this situation as pluralistic. The idea is that situations in
which elections are non-partisan, frequent during the early period, and
situations in which more than one party competes in elections represent
political pluralism, while monopoly of one party is a political monopoly.

In rare cases it is possible for opposition to exist even if the legislative
election was not competitive. This occurs if a competitive presidential
election occurred during the term of a non-competitively elected legislature
(for example, El Salvador in 1977).

0 if the above is not true OR, only in presidential systems, if it is true
BUT either the chief executive is not elected OR was elected unopposed
(unless there was consensus among all parties; as in Chile 1891, 1910).

-1 if the legislature was closed at some point during the year and the state
as of December 31 is unclear.

Note: If all we know is that the elected president run unopposed, the code
is 0.} }

\section{Elections}{


\describe{

\item{legelec}{Number of legislative elections that took place during the
year. It includes general elections, regular elections in which only a part
of the legislature is renewed, and annulled elections, but not by-elections
to replace representatives who did not continue in office. Elections to the
upper house only and elections to constitutional assemblies that do not have
ordinary legislative powers are excluded. Only first rounds are counted.
Note: In several cases constituent assemblies usurped ordinary legislative
powers. In such cases elections are counted.}

\item{preselec}{Number of presidential elections that took place during the
year. In pure presidential systems (in which there is no prime minister),
counted are any kind of elections, direct and indirect, in the latter case
regardless of the constitutional status of the electing assembly. Second
rounds are not counted, while annulled elections are counted. Presidential
plebiscites are included.

Note: The information about presidential elections in systems in which the
president is elected by the parliament is unsystematic and fragmentary.
Elections in systems in which the president is the head of the government,
not only of state, can be identified by setting \code{head_title}=2 (see
below for the definition of \code{head_title}). Presidential elections in
systems in which the head of the government is the prime minister but
presidents are elected by popular vote can be identified by setting
\code{head_title}=1 and \code{presdirect}=1.}

\item{eligible_pr}{(For details, see Appendix 2.) Ratio of the number of
people eligible to vote to the total population. Coded only for years of
legislative or presidential elections. For an explanation of how this
variable was constructed and the sources, see Appendix 2. Note: In some
cases, registration is automatic, so that the number of registered voters is
equal to the number of eligible voters. Whenever they differ and a series
for registered is available, this is the series used. If it is not
available, numbers of eligible voters are used. Finally, in several
instances we do not know whether the numbers refer to registered or eligible
voters. When elections were indirect, this is the proportion of last-stage
electors to the population.}

\item{legpart_pr}{(For details, see Appendix 2.) Ratio of voters in
legislative elections to the total population. Coded only for years of
legislative elections. If elections are indirect, only the number of primary
voters is used.}

\item{prespart_pr}{ (For details, see Appendix 2.) Ratio of voters in
presidential elections to the total population. Coded only for years of
presidential elections. If elections are indirect, only the number of
primary voters is used. From this information, one can also make turnout =
*part/eligible.

Note: This seems to be a more consistent way of getting turnout that the
numbers offered in the sources.}

\item{turnout_leg}{Turnout in legislative elections, according to formula
above. Only available for years with legislative elections.}

\item{turnout_pres}{Turnout in presidential elections, according to formula
above. Only available for years with presidential elections. There are some
obvious problems here - some turnouts exceed 100 of eligible voters.}

\item{participation_f}{Eligible voters (by franchise) as percentage of the
population. (Undocumented in original codebook. There are some obvious
problems here - the variable exceeds 100 for some cases).}

\item{elecparty_leg}{Number of lists presented to voters in legislative
elections. -1 if no legislature or estate parliament or fully appointed
legislature 0 if none, 1 of one, 2 if more.

Note: Several parties offering a joint single list to the voters, "fronts,"
are counted as 1. The coding is based on the number of lists in an election,
not on the number of parties in the legislature. If there is more than one
election during a year, the last one is coded. If all candidates run as
independents coded as 0.}

\item{elecparty_pres}{Number of candidates presented to voters in
presidential elections. 0 if one, 1 if more. Note: Applies whether the
president is directly or indirectly elected. If there are two rounds, the
first one is coded. If there is more than one election during a year, the
last one is coded.}

\item{leg_scheduled}{The year in which a legislative election should occur
if the legislature serves a complete term. Obtained by adding \code{legterm}
to the year in the which the previous legislative election took place.
Because we code the state at the end of a year, \code{leg_scheduled} for a
year in which in election occurred specifies the date of the next scheduled
election.}

\item{pres_scheduled}{The year in which a presidential election should
occur. Obtained by adding \code{presterm} to the year in the which the
previous presidential election took place. Because we code the state at the
end of a year, \code{pres_scheduled} for a year in which in election
occurred specifies the date of the next scheduled election.}

\item{salt_elections}{Number of elections in which the office of the chief
executive was at stake during a year. Counted here are legislative elections
if the chief executive is a prime minister or presidential elections if the
chief executive is the president. Coded according to \code{head_title} (see
below).

Note: There are cases in which there is a prime minister (or equivalent) and
legislative elections but the prime minister is appointed by a monarch
independently of the result of the election, that is, the government can
exist even if it is opposed by a majority of the parliament. One could think
that in cases of such elections the office of the chief executive is not at
stake. It turns out, however, that constitutions do not predict what happens
in the aftermath of elections (Przeworski, Asadurian, Bolhken Thomas, 2011):
sometimes the monarchs ignore the electoral results but at times they
respect the results. Hence, it is not possible to decide ex ante whether the
office of the chief executive was or was not at stake in a particular
election. Except for one flagrant case, that of ???, all legislative
elections in monarchies are coded as \code{salt_elections}.}

\item{result}{(For details, see Appendix 1.) An alphabetic string that
describes how the current incumbent assumed office, indicates whether the
incumbent run for office, and whether the incumbent won or lost, where the
incumbent can be a person, a party, or a hand-picked successor.}

\item{sequence}{(For details, see Appendix 1.) An alphabetic string that
describes the sequence of events in the election and its aftermath. The
first field is the \code{result}, followed by a code indicating the
institutional status of each subsequent chief executive, until someone holds
office for at least one year or until the next election, whichever comes
first.}

\item{lost}{Dummy indicating that the incumbent party or non-partisan
incumbent person ran and lost an election. Coded as -1 if
\code{did_not_run}=1. (\code{did_not_run} is not available in this
dataset.)}

\item{salterel}{(Mnemonic for Strong ALTErnation resulting from an ELection)
Indicates whether partisan control over the chief executive office changed
as a consequence of an election. \code{salterel} is dated in the year in
which the relevant election occurred, not the year new government assumed
office. Hence, the first alternation in history, in the United States, is
coded as of 1800, even though the inauguration occurred in 1801. It is left
as missing in years without the relevant elections. Coded as follows:

1 If the party and the person of the chief executive changes as a result of
an election or, where the chief executive is a monarch, the head of
government changes along partisan lines as a result on an election or the
entire cabinet changes when there is no prime minister. Also applies if
there are no parties but a manifest government candidate, who loses and
yields office. Coded as 1 only if the outgoing chief executive was elected.
Hence, alternation can occur only if the current election did not follow a
coup.

0 If (1) The party or the person of the chief executive wins the election.
(2) There are two elections during the same year, such that the incumbent
party loses the first but wins the second (Iceland in 1959). (3) The
incumbent or its successor (party or person), who is not a caretaker chief
executive, does not run. (4) The incumbent and rival parties form a
coalition. (5) The incumbent loses and remains in office. (6) Neither the
winner nor the loser holds office after an election.

-1 If there are elections but no discernible parties or two successive
independents or the change is between a non-partisan (caretaker, technical,
expert) government and a partisan one, unless the only role of a
non-partisan government was to ensure impartial administration of an
election,

-2 If an election resulted in the defeat of an incumbent (party or person,
previously elected or not) and the winner assumed office but only after
someone other than the winner occupied it (except for a few cases in which
the constitution provides that an interim non-partisan caretaker should
occupy it between the election and the inauguration).

Note: Alternations that result from a previous agreement between parties
count as alternations. Information about the partisan composition of
coalition governments is frequently not available. Hence, \code{salterel} is
coded as 1 even if the new chief executive was a member of an outgoing
coalition government, as long as he is a member of a different party. The
result is a bias in favor of counting alternations.} }
}

\section{Other Events}{


\describe{

\item{dissolution}{Counts the number of times the lower house of the
legislature was dissolved in a particular year. Included as dissolutions are
(1) unconstitutional closures of the legislature and (2) early
constitutional closures. Dissolutions that occur as a formality at the end
of the term of legislature are not coded but early dissolutions are. Coded
-1 if there was no legislature to dissolve.

Note: Dissolutions are early if they occur at least one full year before the
next regularly scheduled election. If an election occurred in year t and the
legislative term is k years, then a dissolution is counted if it occurred in
$t <= year <= t+k_2$: For the 22 OECD countries during the post-1945 period,
dissolutions are coded as early if they occurred more than 12 months before
the end of the legislative term (based on Maravall 2007). Note that this
variable can assume a value of 1 even if \code{dissolution_power}=0, because
dissolutions occur when they are not unilateral and sometimes simply
illegal.}

\item{coups}{Number of successful coups d'etat during a given year.

Note: A coup is any event resulting in an irregular removal or resignation
of the chief executive that involves a violent action or an explicit threat
of resorting to it, by an armed organization. Assassinations of the chief
executive are not considered coups unless the group responsible for the
action takes over the office. Whenever the rules about the replacement of
the chief executive are either not codified or unclear, the force criterion
prevails. The definition excludes resignations under pressure of popular
mobilization if no armed group (legal or not) is involved (resignation of
Carlos Mesa in Bolivia). Similarly, irregular transfers of power among
civilians that do not entail force (such as changes of communist leaders)
are not considered coups. We place no restriction on whether the armed group
causing the replacement is domestic or foreign, nor on the identity of the
incoming ruler. In particular, any military intervention of foreign powers
producing a replacement of the chief executive is coded as a coup, even if
they restore a previously elected ruler (French troops overthrowing Bokassa
in Central African Republic). As a general rule, any replacement of a
military chief executive by another military man is considered a coup,
unless the succession occurred according to pre-established rules
(Figueirido replacing Geisel in Brazil). Specifically, resignations of the
military chief executive caused by votes of non-confidence of irregular
military bodies are considered coups (Galtieri replacing Viola in
Argentina). The variable is compatible to other conventional sources such as
Powell and Thyne (2010), Marshall and Marshall (2009), and Svolik and
Akcinaroglu (2010) for the period 1950-2008, with some difference in the
interpretation of specific events. Information for the pre-1950 era is more
scarce and therefore the coding may be less reliable.}

\item{autocoups}{A dummy variable for any instance in which the ruler
illegally changes constitutional rules to reduce the chances of the
opposition to oppose policies in the legislature or to win elections. Note:
The definition comprises any event in which the incumbent illegally closes
the legislature the OR closes the legislature legally AND changes electoral
rules (including banning parties) or adopts laws that extend his tenure
(Philippines in 1972).} }
}

\section{Leaders}{


\describe{

\item{head_title}{Title of the chief executive. This variable identifies the
formal position the occupant of which is the head of the government. Note
that this variable does not necessarily identify the effective rulers, who
need not occupy government positions. Most general (first) secretaries of
single ruling parties did not, while some rulers who assumed idiosyncratic
titles ("Dictator" "Guardian of Faith," "The Leader") entrusted the
operation of the government to their delegates. Coded as follows:

-1 if it is unclear who the chief executive is or if the country is occupied
by a foreign power,

0 if the monarch assumes directly the direction of the government,

1 if the head of government can be removed by the parliament under "good
behavior,"

2 if the head of government cannot be removed by the parliament or if the
president can remove a prime minister, who is the nominal head of
government, independently of the parliament,

4 if collective executive,

5 if other.

This variable is generated from \code{title_ce} by introducing the following
modifications: (1) If the constitutional status of the effective chief
executive is unclear but there is someone who holds the title of prime
minister or president, coded respectively as 1 or 2. (2) If the nominal
chief executive is the monarch, coded as 1 unless the monarch occupies the
position of prime minister. (3) In cases in which there is both a president
and a prime minister (\code{title_ce}=3), coded as 1 if the government can
be removed by the legislature and cannot be unilaterally removed by the
president, coded as 2 if either of these conditions is false. (4) In cases
in which the executive is nominally plural but has a clear leader and in
cases in which the nominal ruler bears an unconventional title coded as 1 if
there is a prime minister and as 2 otherwise.

Note: There are cases in which the constitution provides that the head of
the government is a prime minister but the constitution is not in force and
the de facto chief executive is the president. There are also systems that
appear to be parliamentary in that the head of government is a prime
minister who can be removed by the parliament but in which he or she can be
also removed by the president without the consent of the parliament. This is
true, for example, of the 2004 Constitution of Central African Republic,
which states that "The President of the Republic is the Chief of the
Executive. The Prime Minister is the Chief of Government" (Article 21) and
gives the President the power to remove the Prime Minister unilaterally
(Article 40). Such cases are coded as \code{head_title}=2.}

\item{heads}{Number of distinct spells of chief executives during a year.
"Spell" refers to a continuous tenure of a person in an office. If the same
person holds office more than once during a particular year, with someone
else serving in between, each tenure of the same person is counted
separately. Juntas and collective presidencies that govern collectively are
counted as one, but rotating presidencies are counted separately. Bearers of
provisional titles are included as well as acting occupants of existing
offices.

Note: (1) If there are several governments in different regions and there is
no national one, the whole period is coded as -1. (2) Juntas are counted as
one head. (3) Acting heads are counted in cases of time overlap between the
nominal head and the acting head; in such cases, the nominal head is not
counted. Includes regents. (4) Governments in rebellion are not counted. (5)
In some cases an office is not occupied during some part of a year. Such
vacancies are not counted.}

\item{head_age}{The number of complete years the current head has been in
office.}

\item{term}{This variable indicates whether the legislative or the
presidential term was completed according to previously specified rules.
Note that a particular term can be only completed or not: this variable
codes the entire term, not the years of particular chief executives.
Right-censored spells are coded as -1. Term is treated differently for
different types of heads:

For presidents:

1 For each year of a term during which (i) the chief executive is elected or
appointed to a previously specified term AND completes the term OR (ii) the
chief executive elected or appointed to a previously specified term dies of
natural causes or resigns for reasons of health AND is succeeded by the
constitutional successor who then completes the term OR (iii) an early
election is held early or the term in office is reduced but completed.

0 For each year of a term during which at least one of the following
conditions holds: (i) the incumbent extends the current term in office
(changes in term limits do not count as extensions of the current term) (ii)
the incumbent is a provisional, acting, or interim chief executive (iii) the
incumbent serves a term that had not been previously specified (iv) the
chief executive is deposed or impeached or assassinated (v) the incumbent
resigns for reasons other than poor health (vi) the incumbent resigns or is
briefly ousted and then comes back to finish the term (vii) the incumbent is
elected or appointed for a new term before finishing the current term and
the new term overlaps with the current one (viii) the term is specifically
designed for a particular person (for example, Pinochet in Chile).

With regard to prime ministers the relevant term is the \code{legterm}:

1 For each year of a legislative term during which all heads of governments
were replaced according to constitutional rules while the parliament
remained open.

0 otherwise. This includes cases in which the prime minister was overthrown
(including assassinated) or imposed by force while the parliament was open
as well as cases in which the parliament was constitutionally dissolved and
the prime minister was replaced while the parliament remained dissolved. It
also includes cases in which the current legislature extended its term and
those in which the parliament was dissolved unconstitutionally. Note: It is
possible for term to be 0 and the last digit of "sequence" to be "E" if the
incumbent extended the term of office while in office and lasted until the
election for the longer term (example is Honduras in 1847).}

\item{first_term}{Year during which the first executive completed a
previously specified constitutional term, whether before or after
independence. If a new unit emerged from a breakdown or unification of
previously existing units, first term is coded separately for this new unit.
Coded according to the rules for \code{term}. For prime ministers, first
term is the last year of the term of the first legislature during which
succession of prime ministers followed constitutional rules. The first term
counts if the legislature was constitutionally dissolved and there was an
early election. Country invariant. Right-censored spells are coded as -1.
Note: First term has to be coded separately from term for the following
reason. Suppose that someone assumed office in year t for a k term period.
He completed the term by August 1 of the year t + k. Hence,
\code{first_term} = t + k. But if the ruler who assumed on August 1, t + k,
did not finish his term, then \code{term}=0 in t + k.}

\item{mentry}{Mode of entry of the last head (chief executive as given by
\code{head_title}) who entered during a particular year. Coded for years in
which an entry occurred (\code{heads}>1 or \code{heads}=1 and the particular
position either did not exist or was not occupied previously).

0 if by force (includes any replacement of a military chief executive by
another military, unless the succession occurred according to
pre-established rules),

1 if openly imposed by a foreign power (includes cases when someone is
elected, overthrown by a coup, and reinstated by an intervention of a
foreign power; does not include clandestine actions, foreign sponsored
coups, foreign pressures, and the like),

2 if selected by any not popularly elected body (e.g., by a self-constituted
junta, a single ruling party) or if self-appointed (even if followed by an
election), unless self-appointment is to the position of prime minister and
the legislature is open,

3 if elected (directly or indirectly but at entry) or if constitutional
successor (say vice-president assuming on the death of the president). Note
that under parliamentarism elected refers to being approved by the
parliament, even if the person was not elected by voters. Prime ministers
appointed by monarchs are coded here as long as the legislature is open and
there is no single party. Includes monarchs who enter by plebiscite or
election by legislature

4 if selected by a constitutionally empowered body but not according to the
rules of succession (say the first vice-president is skipped in favor of
second vice-president).

Note: If there are more than two chief executives during a particular year,
the information about all but the one serving as of December 31 is lost.
This also implies that the mode of entry can equal 3 even if there are coups
during the particular year. What is coded here is entry of a person to/from
a particular office. Hence, if the title of the chief executive changed
during a particular year, say from prime minister to president, an entry to
the new position will be recorded even if the person remains the same
(\code{heads}=1). Note that it is possible that \code{heads}=1 but
\code{mentry} is recorded: this occurs when an office is newly created or if
it was not occupied during some period.}

\item{mexit}{Mode of exit of the first head who exited during a particular
year. Coded only for years in which an exit occurred (\code{heads}>1 or if
\code{heads}=1 and the position was abolished or was not occupied as of the
end of the year).

0 if by force (includes any replacement of a military chief executive by
another military, unless the succession occurred according to
pre-established rules, as well as assassinations, regardless of their
motives),

1 if deposed by a foreign power (indicated by the presence of foreign
military force on the territory; does not include clandestine actions,
foreign sponsored coups, foreign pressures, and the like),

2 if removed by some not popularly elected body (e.g., single ruling party),

3 if lost an election or subject to term limits or lost confidence or
resigned for any reasons, followed by a constitutional successor, or other
good reasons, including peaceful transitions to democracy and removal by a
monarch as long as the legislature is open and there is no single party,

4 if removed by a constitutionally empowered body but not according to
rules,

-1 if died in office (and it is not generally known that the incumbent was
assassinated).

Note: If there are more than two chief executives during a particular year,
the information about all but the one serving as of January 1 is lost. This
also implies that the mode of exit can equal 3 even if there are coups
during the particular year. Note that it is possible that \code{heads}=1 but
\code{mexit} is recorded: this occurs when an office is abolished or becomes
temporarily vacant.

Note about \code{mentry} and \code{mexit}: Direct information about entry
and exit is often difficult to obtain for prime ministers. Because
constitutional changes of prime ministers are routine events, they do not
attract attention of historians. Non-constitutional changes, however,
whether prime ministers being removed by coups or by dissolutions of the
parliament by monarchs, are typically mentioned by historians. In the cases
where such information is not provided by historical sources, we assume that
the entry and the exit were constitutional.} }

\section{Constructed variables in the original dataset}{


\describe{

\item{electoral_age}{Number of years in a period during which elections were
held regularly without being interrupted by any of the following: (1) a coup
or an autocoup, (2) an unconstitutional usurpation of the office of the
chief executive (\code{const_inforce}=0), (3) an occupation by a foreign
power (\code{occupied}=1). Elections are considered to be held regularly if
the period between two successive elections does not exceed the term in
office plus one year, except for war periods during which elections were
postponed. At least two consecutive elections must occur for electoral age
to be counted (the first \code{term} must be completed and the subsequent
election must take place, even if it is immediately followed by an
interruption). \code{electoral_age} is coded as missing if these conditions
are not satisfied, that is, during periods in which no electoral periods
satisfy the above conditions.}

\item{republic_age}{Number of years in a period during which elections were
held regularly without being interrupted with some modicum of the opposition
(\code{opposition}=1). Coded as missing if \code{electoral_age} is missing
or \code{electoral_age} is not missing but \code{opposition}=0. Counted from

\section{Other calculated variables added by this package}{


Note - the instructions in the original codebook for calculating these
variables are not always clear. Errors may have resulted.

\describe{

\item{republic}{Whether the country is a republic during the year.
(\code{republic_age} is not missing). Calculated from \code{republic_age}.}

\item{republican_period}{Identifier for periods of republican and
non-republican rule in a given country. Increases with each change between
republic and non-republic.}

\item{cum_salterel}{Cumulative number of strong alternations in a republican
period. Calculated from \code{salterel}.}

\item{cum_term}{Cumulative years in which a term is completed. Calculated
from the cumulative sum of \code{term} for each \code{republican_period} in
a country.}

\item{democracy}{Whether the country is a democracy according to the
formula: elections are held regularly without being interrupted, with some
modicum of the opposition (\code{republic_age} is not missing), following an
alternation in office (\code{salterel}=1) after which the winner completed a
full term. Includes periods before independence.}

\item{democracy2}{Whether the country is a democracy according to the
formula: elections are held regularly without being interrupted, with some
modicum of the opposition (\code{republic_age} is not missing), following an
alternation in office (\code{salterel}=1) after which the winner completed a
full term. Does not include periods before independence.}

\item{democracy_age}{Number of years of democracy2.}

\item{democratic_period}{Identifier for periods of full democracy
(\code{democracy2 = TRUE}) and non-democracy in a given country. Increases
by 1 with each change in \code{democracy2}.}

\item{regime}{This variable is coded only for years following independence.
It is missing before independence even if the variables on the bases of
which it is created are not missing.

0 if \code{electoral_age} is missing. There are two distinct reasons why it
may be missing: either elections are not held regularly or they are held but
the winner does not complete a term in office or makes an autocoup.
Elections are considered not to be held if (1) there is a constitution that
specifies the length of term of the chief executive (or the legislature) and
this period is exceeded by more than one year, except for war years, (2)
there is no constitution or the constitution does not provide for elections
and no elections are held during this period.

1 if \code{electoral_age} is not missing and \code{opposition}=0 (or
\code{republic_age} is missing). These are regimes in which elections are
held regularly and the winners (or their constitutional successors) complete
electoral terms but either elections are uncontested or there is one party
and independents or parties are banned and everyone runs as independent.
Note that if everyone runs as independents it is possible for the incumbent
government to lose an election, as in Swaziland in 1993. It is also possible
for the incumbent to lose if the regime had no opposition up to some time
when a competitive election occurred but the winner did not complete a term,
as in Honduras in 1852. Finally, incumbents can lose when \code{regime}=1 if
the election was competitive but at the end of the year the opposition was
suppressed, as in Panama in 1968.

2 if \code{republic_age} is not missing, that is if \code{electoral_age} is
not missing and \code{opposition}=1.

3 if \code{democracy_age} is not missing.}

\item{regime_period}{Identifier for regime periods in a given country.
Increases by 1 with each change in \code{regime}.}

\section{Appendix 1. Coding Electoral Sequences}{


The unit of observation is a sequence of events following an election in
which the office of the chief executive is at stake. An event is an election
and the subsequent occupancies of the chief executive office by different
persons. These events are coded as answers to questions formulated below.
The general syntax of coding consists of answers to who? and did (s)he?,
separated by commas. For example, suppose an incumbent, who originally came
into office by force, presented himself in the election, won, assumed and
stayed in office for four years. This sequence of events is coded as FPY,
IY, 4: FPY is a result of the election, IY records that the incumbent
assumed office, and 4 that he stayed that many years.

Note that only events following the elections are coded, with the exception
of the manner in which the current incumbent arrived in office. The first
three digits summarize information about the election. They are recorded
under the variable called result. \describe{

\item{result}{The first digit answers the question How did the incumbent
come into office?

Note: The variable coding who is the chief executive is \code{head_title}.
The incumbent is the ruler at the moment when the election occurs. It makes
no difference how the current ruler assumed office: if there is an elected
chief executive, he is overthrown, and the general who overthrows calls an
election, the general is the incumbent. There are cases in which the
constitution requires the incumbent ruler to resign some short time before
the election and an institutionally designated person (say, chief justice)
administers the election. In such cases and only in such cases the incumbent
is the outgoing chief executive. If this is first election after
independence and the colony was run by a governor general (or equivalent)
without local prime minister, there is no incumbent. The monarch, even if
(s)he is the nominal chief executive is not considered the incumbent unless
(s)he occupies the office of the prime minister. The incumbent is the head
of the government.

Answers to the first question are coded as:

F By overthrowing someone else (If the incumbent originally came into power
by force but then had himself elected, he is elected. Plebiscites, however,
do not count as elections.)

A Appointed by a non-elected body (If the king appoints a PM in the absence
of parliament or some junta takes over and appoints someone, not necessarily
one of its members, the chief executive)

E Elected (An incumbent who is a constitutional successor of an elected
incumbent, say vice-president who assumes office upon the death of the
president, inherits his status.)

T A non-partisan or caretaker incumbent appointed by an elected body
(parliament, sometimes party leaders)

0 (zero) There was no incumbent.

The second digit answers the question, Did the incumbent run in the
election? Coded as follows:

P if the incumbent person run (distinguished systematically only under
presidentialism)

S if a successor run

N if the incumbent person did not run and there was no successor or if there
was no incumbent (Includes cases coded as T in the first digit). Note:
Successor is coded differently under presidentialism and parliamentarism.
Under presidentialism, S is a different member of the same party or a
candidate designated by the incumbent government. Under parliamentarism, as
long as the party of the incumbent is present in the election it is always
coded as S.

The final (third) digit answers the question Did the incumbent/successor
win? The answers to this question can be Y yes N no ? cannot be determined

Note: If the challenger cannot form a government and the incumbent remains
in office, then the incumbent won.

Some examples: TN,: the incumbent was a non-partisan caretaker, who did not
run in the election. FPY: the incumbent came to office by force, ran in the
election, and won. Note again that if someone who originally came into
office by force had been elected once, he becomes an elected incumbent.
Hence, F applies only to the first election after a coup. ESN: either a
successor of a president (but not the incumbent president himself) or the
party of the prime minister ran in the election and lost. ES?: either a
successor of a president (but not the incumbent president himself) or the
party of the prime minister ran in the election and it is not clear who won
(no presidential candidate won a majority, which is required by the
constitution, or no party won a majority of seats necessary to form the
government).}

\item{sequence}{The variable called sequence consists of the result,
followed by answers to the following pairs of questions, pairs separated by
commas, with as many pairs as necessary, and a one-digit field indicating
how long the last chief executive remained in office. The full syntax is
thus: How did the incumbent get in? Did he run? (If he ran, did he win?),
Who assumed office? Did he stay in power?, ... (as many times as necessary),
How long? Who assumed office? In principle, everyone who assumed the office
of the chief executive after an election, regardless for how long, is
recorded, with the exception of constitutionally required caretakers. The
answers to this question can be:

I incumbent (the person who was the incumbent at the moment of the election)

W a winner of the election (other than the incumbent person)

L a loser of the election who entered by force (or other non-constitutional
means)

R a loser of the election who entered by constitutional means (this
typically occurred when the king appointed a member of the losing party and
the parliament was in session and did not or could not vote non-confidence)

M military (If they take power directly. If the king appoints or a
parliament elects a military officer, they are not military here.)

A if a non-elected power (king, military, one party) imposes someone who is
neither a winner or a loser (non-party, technical, caretaker. For example,
King Boris of Bulgaria appointed a Russian general who was not a party
member).

T if an elected power (parliament, party leaders, indirectly elected
president) selects someone who is neither a winner or a loser (non-party,
technical, caretaker. For example, the President of the Bolivian Senate was
appointed by the Congress as caretaker when no one could muster majority
required by the constitution.)

C if an institutional actor came in by force or by otherwise violating
constitutional rules (For example, President Kasavubu removed PM Lumumba or
the king assumed power by a coup).

? cannot tell

Notes: The incumbent person remains I in the entire sequence that follows.
Other members of his party are W if the incumbent's party won, L or R if it
lost. Suppose the incumbent party lost, the king appointed a member of the
incumbent party, then appointed the original incumbent until the next
election. The sequence would be ESN,RN,IY,E Party splits are ignored. If
there was an interim constitutional occupant between the election and
inauguration, he is coded as T. For example, the sequence in which the
incumbent did not run, an interim person took over, and then the winner
assumed would be EN,TN,W. . .

The answer to the question Did he/she stay in power? can be: Y yes N no

Note: The answer entails a stopping rule. The sequence of events is
considered to be completed if the current occupant survived in power at
least one year and neither the incumbent, nor the winner, nor the loser
returned to office before the next election or if the current occupant
lasted less than one year but until the next election. Prime ministers of
the same party and constitutional successors of elected presidents are
considered here to be the same persons as their predecessors: if a president
dies within a year and he is followed by the vice-president,
constitutionally designated to take over, and if the total tenure of the two
is at least one year, then the answer is Y. If the president is overthrown
by force, however, then the answer concerning him is N and the
vice-president, even if he is a constitutionally designated, is treated as a
new occupant of office. Hence, "not return" means here that neither the
original incumbent nor anyone who occupied office in the aftermath of the
election returned to office before the next election.

If the answer is Y the last digit answers the question How long?, with two
possible answers: Length of time, measured in full years if the current
ruler did not last until the next election (but at least one full year) or
if the next election did not take place within one year of the scheduled
date and the current ruler lasted until the scheduled date. For example, if
the next scheduled election was supposed to take place within 5 years and
the first person who survived in office at least one year after the current
election was deposed 3 years later, the answer is "3". In turn, if the next
election did not occur until 12 years later and the first person who lasted
one year survived the 5 years, the answer is "12," even if this person was
deposed 7 years after assuming office. "E" if the current ruler lasted until
the next election. If the answer is N coding continues, repeating answers to
both questions as long as necessary. If there is more than one election
during the same year, each election is coded as above with the sign j
separating the elections. For example, if an elected incumbent run, won,
lasted until the new election the same year, run again, and lost, the
sequence is coded as ESY,IY,EjESN,WY,E.} }
}

\section{Caveats}{


Caveats are many and some are consequential.

\describe{ \item{Missing data}{In principle, the data should cover all
elections that selected chief executives in all countries that existed at
any time after 1917, including periods before independence. There are good
reasons to suspect that not all such elections are included: the historical
record is simply absent for some countries during the early periods. The
bias of inclusion is against early elections, particularly those in
dependent territories.}

\item{Chief executives}{The elections that are coded are intended to be
those which potentially determine the selection of the chief executive.
Chief executives are presidents, directly or indirectly elected, who are
heads of governments and cannot be dismissed by the legislature while in
good conduct or prime ministers whenever governments serve at the discretion
of the legislature. In systems in which presidents and prime ministers share
executive prerogatives and prime ministers can be removed by the
legislature, chief executives are prime ministers. Note that if a country
changed from parliamentary to presidential system (or vice versa, which is
less frequent), the incumbent is the occupant of the previous office. In
terms of government formation, parliamentarism is a much more complex system
than presidentialism. Tracing the individual prime ministers is often
unfeasible. Hence, sequences are more accurate under presidentialism than
under parliamentarism. A sequence ESY,WY,E under presidentialism states
exactly that the incumbent person was not a candidate, that a successor of
this person won the election, assumed office, and served until the next
election. The same sequence under parliamentarism, however, may only
indicate that the incumbent party run and won the election and one or more
of its members (but not the incumbent prime minister) held office until the
next election. To put it differently, a sequence ESY,WN,WN,WY,3 under
presidentialism may be coded as only ESY,WY,3 under parliamentarism. Note
that if the person who occupied office immediately after the election was
the outgoing incumbent, these sequences would be coded respectively as
EPY,IN,WN,WY,3 under presidentialism and as ESY,IN,WY,E under
parliamentarism (even if WY may stand here for several prime ministers from
the same party).}

\item{General}{Some elections constitute truly convoluted events and the
exact sequence of events is often difficult to identify. Different
historical sources frequently ignore different details, so that codes based
on particular sources could be different. Moreover, the information is
sometimes inconsistent, so that making sense of it is not always possible.
One must suspect, therefore, that the coding contains errors.} }

an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
