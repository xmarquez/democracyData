\title{Freedom House "Freedom in the World" data}
\source{
The "Freedom in the World" dataset from Freedom House, updated to
2023 (Freedom in the World 2024 Report). Original data and methodology is
available at \url{https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world}.
}
\usage{
download_fh(
  url,
  include_territories = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  return_raw = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The URL of the dataset. Defaults to \url{https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/Country_and_Territory_Ratings_and_Statuses_FIW_1973-2024.xlsx}.}

\item{include_territories}{Whether to include scores from non-independent
territories (e.g., Indian Kashmir, Northern Ireland) compiled by FH.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print a running commentary of what the function is
doing while processing the data.}

\item{return_raw}{Whether to return the raw data, with minimal processing.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to \link{country_year_coder}.}
}
\value{
A time-series tidy version of the FH dataset, with the following
variables:
\itemize{
\item country: The original country name.
\item year: The calendar year. This is approximate. The surveys cover specific
periods in the original data that do not always overlap with a single year.
In particular, the year 1981 is "skipped" -- a single survey covers Jan.
1981 - Aug. 1982 and its value is assigned to 1982 here. Surveys from 1981
to 1988 covered the periods Jan. 1981-Aug. 1982, Aug. 1982-Nov. 1983, Nov.
1983-Nov. 1984, Nov. 1984-Nov. 1985, Nov. 1985-Nov. 1986, Nov. 1986-Nov.
1987, Nov. 1987-Nov. 1988, and Nov.1988-Dec.1989, and results are assigned
to years 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989.
\item pr: Political rights, from 1 to 7, where 7 means more violations of
political rights. Note that South Africa in 1973 was assigned two values
(one for white and one for black South Africa). Here it is given the "not
free" values. See notes for details.
\item cl: Civil liberties, from 1 to 7, where 7 means more violations of civil
rights. Note that South Africa in 1973 was assigned two values (one for
white and one for black South Africa). Here it is given the "not free"
values. See notes for details
\item status: Political status. Free, not free, or partly free. See notes for
details.
\item fh_total: Sum of pr and cl. Higher values are "less free."
\item fh_total_reversed: Reversed fh_total, so that higher values are "more
free."

\section{Standard descriptive variables (generated by this package)}{

\describe{

\item{extended_country_name}{The name of the country in the Gleditsch-Ward
system of states, or the official name of the
entity (for non-sovereign entities and states not in the Gleditsch and Ward
system of states) or else a common name for disputed cases that do not have
an official name (e.g., Western Sahara, Hyderabad). The Gleditsch and Ward
scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.
For details, see Gleditsch, Kristian S. & Michael D. Ward. 1999. "Interstate
System Membership: A Revised List of the Independent States since 1816."
International Interactions 25: 393-413. The list can be found at
\url{http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html}.}

\item{GWn}{Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code, from the Gleditsch and
Ward list of independent states.}

\item{cown}{The Correlates of War numeric country code, 2016 version. This
differs from Gleditsch and Ward's numeric country code in a few cases. See
\url{http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/state-system-membership} for
the full list.}

\item{in_GW_system}{Whether the state is "in system" (that is, is
independent and sovereign), according to Gleditsch and Ward, for this
particular date. Matches at the end of the year; so, for example South
Vietnam 1975 is \code{FALSE} because, according to Gleditsch and Ward, the
country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
\code{TRUE} for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.} }

\section{Methodological notes}{


From FH's Freedom in the World methodology discussion:

Methodological changes have been effected periodically. For discussions of
these changes, please consult the methodology essays for various editions
of the survey.

For a full explanation of the current methodology, please consult the most
recent edition of the survey.

"PR" stands for "Political Rights," "CL" stands for "Civil Liberties," and
"Status" is the Freedom Status. Political Rights and Civil Liberties are
measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree
of Freedom and seven the lowest.

Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights
and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated "Free";
between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free," and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free."
Beginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average
ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free," and those between 5.5
and 7.0 are "Not Free." Ratings for territories are not included in this
table.

Several countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or
merged with a neighboring state. Scores for these countries are given only
for the period of their existence as independent states.

The survey years refer to the various editions of Freedom in the World,
except for Jan.-Feb. 1973 through Jan.-Feb. 1977, which are from the
bimonthly journal Freedom at Issue. The first Freedom in the World
book-length survey was the 1978 edition.

For 1972, South Africa was rated as "White" (2,3 Free) and "Black" (5,6 Not
Free). For Yugoslavia, ratings from 1999 to 2002 were for the country that
remained following the departures between 1991 and 1992 of Slovenia,
Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In February 2003, the Yugoslav
parliament adopted a constitutional charter establishing the state of
Serbia and Montenegro. Thus, beginning in 2003, Yugoslavia is listed as
"Serbia and Montenegro."	The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved
when Montenegro withdrew in June 2006, making Serbia an independent state.
Thus, the ratings for Serbia and Montenegro are listed separately beginning
in 2006.	 Kosovo was first listed as a territory beginning in 1992. Since
2009, it is listed as an independent country. South Sudan was first listed
as an independent country in 2011 after officially separating from Sudan in
July 2011.	The former Zaire is listed under Congo (Kinshasa), and the
former Western Samoa is listed under Samoa.
