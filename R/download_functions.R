#'@section Variables:
#'
#'  \describe{
#'
#'  \item{p5}{Polity5 revision indicator. p5 = 1 if the country-year has
#'  undergone systematic review in version 5. Country-years coded 0 report
#'  PolityIV values.}
#'
#'  \item{cyear}{Unique country code-year identifier.}
#'
#'  \item{polity_annual_ccode}{Numeric Country Code. Derived from the Correlates
#'  of War country codes, but with some small differences.}
#'
#'  \item{scode}{Alphabetical Country Code. Derived from the Correlates of War
#'  country codes, but with some small differences.}
#'
#'  \item{polityIV_country}{The original country name in the Polity 5 data.}
#'
#'  \item{year}{The calendar year.}
#'
#'  \item{flag}{From the Polity 5 manual, 2020 edition:
#'
#'  Each case (country-year) is flagged with this trichotomous indicator
#'  denoting the coders' general confidence in the component variable scores
#'  assigned during a Polity annual update. A "0" code indicates reasonable
#'  confidence in the codings listed and is assigned to all historical cases. A
#'  "1" code indicates that codings covering a period of up to five years since
#'  a recent polity change are considered tentative as new authority patterns
#'  emerge and coalesce; these cases are subject to review and possible revision
#'  or "smoothing" ... A "2" code indicates that information is limited and, so,
#'  there are reservations concerning the code assigned, often because a polity
#'  change has occurred very recently and insufficient time has elapsed to
#'  render a confident judgement of the nature of authority changes; the codes
#'  assigned are considered a "best assessment" that require further review and
#'  possible revision (p. 12).}
#'
#'  \item{fragment}{From the Polity5 manual, 2020 edition, pp. 12-13:
#'
#'  Polity Fragmentation: This variable codes the operational existence of a
#'  separate polity, or polities, comprising substantial territory and
#'  population within the recognized borders of the state and over which the
#'  coded polity exercises no effective authority (effective authority may be
#'  participatory or coercive). Local autonomy arrangements voluntarily
#'  established and accepted by both central and local authorities are not
#'  considered fragmentation. A polity that can not exercise relatively
#'  effective authority over at least 50 percent of its established territory is
#'  necessarily considered to be in a condition of "state failure" (i.e.,
#'  interruption or interregnum, see below, that may or may not coincide with
#'  active civil war). Polity fragmentation may result from open warfare (active
#'  or latent) or foreign occupation and may continue in the absence of open
#'  warfare as a situation of de facto separation remains unresolved and
#'  unchallenged by the state. Examples of de facto separation are northern
#'  Cyprus since 1975 (with Turkish occupation), NagornoKarabakh in Azerbaijan
#'  since 1994 (with Armenian occupation), Republika Srpska in Bosnia since 1995
#'  (with NATO occupation), Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia from 1994,
#'  Chechnya in Russia from 1996 to 1999, and Kosovo in Serbia from 1999 to 2008
#'  (Kosovo became a contested, independent state in 2008). This variable is
#'  coded beginning only in the year 2000; it is blank for all prior years
#'  (i.e., it has not yet been coded historically).
#'
#'  (0) No overt fragmentation
#'
#'  (1) Slight fragmentation: Less than ten percent of the country's territory
#'  is effectively under local authority and actively separated from the central
#'  authority of the regime.
#'
#'  (2) Moderate fragmentation: Ten to twenty-five percent of the country's
#'  territory is effectively ruled by local authority and actively separated
#'  from the central authority of the regime.
#'
#'  (3) Serious fragmentation: Over twenty-five percent (and up to fifty
#'  percent) of the country's territory is effectively ruled by local authority
#'  and actively separated from the central authority of the regime.}

#'  \item{democ}{Institutionalized democracy indicator, 0-10 scale. See PolityIV
#'  users' manual at [http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/p5manualv2018.pdf](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/p5manualv2018.pdf)}
#'
#'  \item{autoc}{Institutionalized autocracy indicator, 0-10 scale. See PolityIV
#'  users' manual at [http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/p5manualv2018.pdf](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/p5manualv2018.pdf)}
#'
#'  \item{polity}{Annual polity index (`autoc` - `democ`), including values for
#'  interruption (-66), interregnum (-77), and transition periods (-88). Higher
#'  values are more democratic. Note that the Polity users' manual (pp. 16-17)
#'  says that "The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in
#'  recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the
#'  overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this
#'  application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index
#'  values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the
#'  original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority (1975)
#'  and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary
#'  utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more
#'  detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic
#'  authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist
#'  in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data
#'  series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that
#'  autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority
#'  spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the
#'  original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for
#'  examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note
#'  that the middle of the implied POLITY "spectrum" is somewhat muddled in
#'  terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and
#'  AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses
#'  of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original
#'  Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.}
#'
#'  \item{polity2}{Annual polity2 index, interpolating values for interruption
#'  (-66 is treated as `NA`), interregnum *-77 is treated as 0), and transition
#'  periods (prorated across the transition). Higher values are more
#'  democratic.}
#'

#'  corresponding EYEAR and EDATE of the initial polity change (i.e., the first
#'  year record) in a multi-year regime change is repeated in the record of the
#'  final year of the multi-year change. This has been done to facilitate
#'  retrieval of information concerning the beginning and ending polities in

#'
#'  \item{interim}{The Polity users' manual says (p. 32) "Interim Polity Code:
#'  Interim Polity coding is used to denote (1) the short-lived nature of a
#'  distinct change in regime authority that spans only a portion of the coded
#'  year (i.e., a POLITY code) that would not otherwise be recorded due to the
#'  annualized structure of the Polity data, (2) a "transition" period of three
#'  years or less while a new Polity is being established (i.e., -88 code), (3)
#'  an "interruption" period of any length while a Polity remains under foreign
#'  authority (i.e., -66 code), or (4) an "interregnal" period denoting a
#'  collapse of central authority (i.e., -77 code). INTERIM is coded for each
#'  year between the end date (EDATE) of the previous Polity and the begin date
#'  (BDATE) of the subsequent Polity whenever standardized authority codes are
#'  used or when a series of incremental changes over a period of three years

#'
#'   * country: The original country name.
#'
#'   * year: The calendar year. This is approximate. The surveys cover specific
#'   periods in the original data that do not always overlap with a single year.
#'   In particular, the year 1981 is "skipped" -- a single survey covers Jan.
#'   1981 - Aug. 1982 and its value is assigned to 1982 here. Surveys from 1981

#' @section Methodological notes:
#'
#'   From FH's Freedom in the World methodology discussion:
#'
#'   Methodological changes have been effected periodically. For discussions of
#'   these changes, please consult the methodology essays for various editions
#'   of the survey.
#'
#'   For a full explanation of the current methodology, please consult the most
#'   recent edition of the survey.
#'
#'   "PR" stands for "Political Rights," "CL" stands for "Civil Liberties," and
#'   "Status" is the Freedom Status. Political Rights and Civil Liberties are
#'   measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree
#'   of Freedom and seven the lowest.
#'
#'   Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights
#'   and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated "Free";
#'   between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free," and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free."
#'   Beginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average
#'   ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free," and those between 5.5
#'   and 7.0 are "Not Free." Ratings for territories are not included in this
#'   table.
#'
#'   Several countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or
#'   merged with a neighboring state. Scores for these countries are given only
#'   for the period of their existence as independent states.
#'
#'   The survey years refer to the various editions of Freedom in the World,
#'   except for Jan.-Feb. 1973 through Jan.-Feb. 1977, which are from the
#'   bimonthly journal Freedom at Issue. The first Freedom in the World
#'   book-length survey was the 1978 edition.
#'
#'   For 1972, South Africa was rated as "White" (2,3 Free) and "Black" (5,6 Not
#'   Free). For Yugoslavia, ratings from 1999 to 2002 were for the country that
#'   remained following the departures between 1991 and 1992 of Slovenia,
#'   Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In February 2003, the Yugoslav
#'   parliament adopted a constitutional charter establishing the state of
#'   Serbia and Montenegro. Thus, beginning in 2003, Yugoslavia is listed as
#'   "Serbia and Montenegro."	The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved
#'   when Montenegro withdrew in June 2006, making Serbia an independent state.
#'   Thus, the ratings for Serbia and Montenegro are listed separately beginning
#'   in 2006.	 Kosovo was first listed as a territory beginning in 1992. Since
#'   2009, it is listed as an independent country. South Sudan was first listed
#'   as an independent country in 2011 after officially separating from Sudan in
#'   July 2011.	The former Zaire is listed under Congo (Kinshasa), and the
#'   former Western Samoa is listed under Samoa.

#'
#'   From FH's Freedom in the World methodology discussion:
#'
#'   Methodological changes have been effected periodically. For discussions of
#'   these changes, please consult the methodology essays for various editions
#'   of the survey.
#'
#'   For a full explanation of the current methodology, please consult the most
#'   recent edition of the survey.
#'
#'   "PR" stands for "Political Rights," "CL" stands for "Civil Liberties," and
#'   "Status" is the Freedom Status. Political Rights and Civil Liberties are
#'   measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree
#'   of Freedom and seven the lowest.
#'
#'   Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights
#'   and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated "Free";
#'   between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free," and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free."
#'   Beginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average
#'   ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free," and those between 5.5
#'   and 7.0 are "Not Free."
#'
#'   Several countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or
#'   merged with a neighboring state. Scores for these countries are given only
#'   for the period of their existence as independent states.
